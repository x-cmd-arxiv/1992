of two locally coupled 1+1 dimensional systems (interfaces). Measuring
numerically the tilt-dependent velocity we construct a set of stochastic
continuum equations describing the fluctuations in the model
  The scaling predicted by the equations are studied analytically using dynamic
renormalization group and compared with simulation results. When the coupling
is symmetric, the well known KPZ exponents are recovered. If one of the systems
is fluctuating independently, an increase in the roughness exponent is observed
for the other one.

symmetry-related tunneling paths that connect the same initial and final
configurations. The topological phase factors of the corresponding tunneling
amplitudes can lead to destructive interference between the different paths, so
that the total tunneling amplitude is zero. In the study of tunneling between
different ground state configurations of the Kagom\'{e}-lattice quantum
Heisenberg antiferromagnet, this occurs when the spin $s$ is half-odd-integer.
