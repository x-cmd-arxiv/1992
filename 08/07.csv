"alg-geom/9208002","Kenneth A. Ribet","Kenneth A. Ribet","Abelian varieties over Q and modular forms","19 pages, AMS-TeX 2.1",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  This paper gives a conjectural characterization of those elliptic curves over
the field of complex numbers which ""should"" be covered by standard modular
curves. The elliptic curves in question all have algebraic j-invariant, so they
can be viewed as curves over Q-bar, the field of algebraic numbers. The
condition that they satisfy is that they must be isogenous to all their Galois
conjugates. Borrowing a term from B.H. Gross, ""Arithmetic on elliptic curves
with complex multiplication,"" we say that the elliptic curves in question are
""Q-curves."" Since all complex multiplication elliptic curves are Q-curves (with
this definition), and since they are all uniformized by modular forms
(Shimura), we consider only non-CM curves for the remainder of this abstract.
We prove:
  1. Let C be an elliptic curve over Q-bar. Then C is a Q-curve if and only if
C is a Q-bar simple factor of an abelian variety A over Q whose algebra of
Q-endomorphisms is a number field of degree dim(A). (We say that abelian
varieties A/Q with this property are of ""GL(2) type."")
  2. Suppose that Serre's conjecture on mod p modular forms are correct (Ref:
Duke Journal, 1987). Then an abelian variety A over Q is of GL(2)-type if and
only if it is a simple factor (over Q) of the Jacobian J_1(N) for some integer
N\ge1. (The abelian variety J_1(N) is the Jacobian of the standard modular

seeds in the structure formation of the universe. The important configurations
are those who will be able to collapse. The type of configurations that I will
consider are half knots and true knots. I define a half knot as one that covers
more than a half-$S^3$, and a true knot as a configuration that covers the
whole of $S^3$. Configurations that are half knots will be able to collapse, a
new argument for this collapse criterion is given in this paper. I also give
some critical remarks on the method of using the total winding number as a
criterion for identifying a knot. I propose another more direct method and make
use of it when I estimate the probability for formation of both true and half
knots by numerical simulations.Taking into account the chance of annihilation
the probability for collapse is found to be in the interval $p_{coll} \in
[0.01,0.04]$. In the skyrmion picture of hadrons the investigations of
formation of true knots are important, and some implications of my result on
the predictions of a ""topological"" theory of baryon production in jets are
discussed.

like diffusion limited aggregation or dielectric breakdown. We show that, if
the developing patterns is sufficiently complex, a scale invariant noise
spectrum is generated, in agreement with the hypothesis that the system is in a
self organized critical state. The intrinsic noise generated in the evolution
is shown to be independent of the (extrinsic) stochastic aspects of the growth.
Instead, it is related to the complexity of the generated pattern.

quark jet is a probe of the transverse spin of the quark initiating the jet.
This results in a new spin-dependent fragmentation function that acts at the
twist-2 level. One example of a process where it contributes is semi-inclusive
deeply inelastic scattering with a transversely polarized nucleon target but
with an {\em unpolarized} electron beam. This process is treated in detail.
Another process is the cross section for singly polarized hadron-hadron
scattering when two high $p_{\perp}$ hadrons are measured in the final state
and are close to back-to-back in azimuth. The new fragmentation function is
sensitive to the coupling of the fragmentation process to (spontaneous) chiral
symmetry breaking.

Background (CMB) anisotropies recently detected by COBE. This implies a {\it

fluctuations. We consider the constraints imposed on $n<1$ (``tilted"")
power--law fluctuation spectra, taking into account the contribution from both
scalar and tensor waves, as predicted by power--law inflation. The
gravitational--wave contribution to CMB anisotropies generally reduces the
