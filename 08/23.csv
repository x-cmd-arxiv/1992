of the two-dimensional Ising model. For moments of the magnetisation density,
we find good agreement with the new ansatz of Borgs and Koteck\'y, and clear
evi consequences of the convexity of the free energy are not adequately treated
in either of these approaches.\lb {\it Keywords}\/: Finite-size scaling, 2-d

semiclassical approximation. We compute the fixed-area partition function to
one-loop order and obtain the string susceptibility on Riemann surfaces of
arbitrary genus. Our result is consistent with the approach using techniques of
conformal field theories.
