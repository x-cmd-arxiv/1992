studied. For a particular power spectrum, predicted Sachs-Wolfe effects are
calculated for two cases: Gaussian (random phase) configuration, and a specific
kind of non-Gaussian configuration. We obtain a result that the Sachs-Wolfe
effect for the latter case is smaller when each temperature fluctuation is
properly normalized with respect to the corresponding mass fluctuation ${\delta
M\over M}(R)$. The physical explanation and the generality of the result are
discussed.

  Structures, and Correlation Functions","12 pages, talk",,,,"hep-th",,"  We describe a self-consistent canonical quantization of Liouville theory in
terms of canonical free fields. In order to keep the non-linear Liouville
dynamics, we use the solution of the Liouville equation as a canonical
transformation. This also defines a Liouville vertex operator. We show, in
particular, that a canonical quantized conformal and local quantum Liouville
theory has a quantum group structure, and we discuss correlation functions for
non-critical strings.

theory, in the presence of Maxwell fields, is obtained by $O(d,d)$
transformations of simple backgrounds with $d$ toroidal isometries. In all the
examples in which we find a (closed) expanding universe, such that the universe
admits a smooth, complete initial value hypersurface, a naked singularity may
form only at the time when the universe collapses. The discrete symmetry group
$O(d,d,Z)$ identifies different cosmological solutions with a background
corresponding to a (relatively) simple CFT, and therefore, may be useful in
understanding the properties of naked singularities in string theory.
