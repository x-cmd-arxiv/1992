leptons, neutrinos can have tiny charges consistent with electromagnetic gauge
invariance. There are three types of non-standard electric charge, given by
$Q_{st} + \epsilon(L_i - L_j)$, where $i, j = e, \mu, \tau$ $(i \neq j)$,
$Q_{st}$ is standard electric charge, $L_i$ is a family-lepton--number, and
$\epsilon$ is an arbitrary parameter which is put equal to zero in the usual
incarnation of the MSM. These three non-standard electric charges are of
considerable theoretical interest because they are compatible with the MSM
Lagrangian and $SU(3)_c \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ gauge anomaly
cancellation. The two most conspicuous implications of such non-standard
electric charges are the presence of two generations of massless charged
neutrinos and a breakdown in electromagnetic universality for $e$, $\mu$ and
$\tau$. We use results from (i) charge conservation in $\beta$-decay, (ii)
physical consequences of charged atoms in various contexts, (iii) the anomalous
magnetic moments of charged leptons, (iv) neutrino-electron scattering, (v)
energy loss in red giant and white dwarf stars, and (vi) limits on a
cosmologically induced thermal photon mass, to place bounds on $\epsilon$.
While the constraints derived for $\epsilon$ 10^{-21}$), the $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$
case allows $\epsilon$ to be as large as $10^{-14}$.

bilocal effective meson action with a potential kernel given in relativistic
covariant form. The corresponding Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter
equations are investigated in detail. By introducing weak interactions into the
theory we study heavy meson properties as decay constants and semileptonic
decay amplitudes. Thereby, the transition from the bilocal field description to
the heavy quark effective theory is discussed. Considering as example the
semileptonic decay of a pseudoscalar $B$--meson into a pseudoscalar $D$--meson
we obtain an integral expression for the corresponding Isgur--Wise function in
terms of meson wave functions.

family whose main feature is that both $U(1)$ fields have electric and magnetic
charges, the axion field still being trivial. We show the supersymmetry of
these solutions in the extreme case, in which the corresponding generalization
of the Bogomolnyi bound is saturated and a naked singularity is on the verge of
being visible to external observers. Then we study the action of a subset of
the $SL(2,R)$ group of electric-magnetic duality rotations that generates a
non-trivial axion field on those solutions. This group of transformations is an
exact symmetry of the $N=4$ $d=4$ ungauged supergravity equations of motion. It
has been argued recently that it could be an exact symmetry of the full
effective string theory. The generalization of the Bogomolnyi bound is
invariant under the full $SL(2,R)$ and the solutions explicitly rotated are
shown to be supersymmetric if the originals are. We conjecture that any
$SL(2,R)$ transformation will preserve supersymmetry.
