cosmic microwave background radiation, arising from both gravity waves as well
as adiabatic density perturbations, generated by a common inflationary
mechanism in the early Universe.
  We find that for inflationary models predicting power law primordial spectra
%$a(t) \propto t^p, p > 1$, $\dk^2 \propto k^n$, the relative contribution to
the quadrupole anisotropy from gravity waves and scalar density perturbations,
depends crucially upon $n$. For $n < 0.87$, gravity waves perturb the CMBR by a
larger amount than density perturbations, whereas for $n > 0.87$ the reverse is
true. %For nearly exponential inflation, on the other hand, the contribution to
the %microwave anisotropy from scalar density perturbations always exceeds
%that due to gravity waves. Normalising the amplitude of the density
perturbation spectrum at large scales, using the observed value of the COBE
quadrupole, we determine $(\delta M /M)_{16}$ -- the rms density contrast on
scales $\sim 16 h_{50}^{-1}$ Mpc, for cosmological models with cold dark
matter. We find that for $n < 0.75$, a large amount of biasing is required in
order to reconcile theory with observations.
