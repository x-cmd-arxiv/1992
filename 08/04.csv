systems on MIMD parallel computers with large numbers of processors. The method
divides physical space into rectangular cells which are assigned to processors
and combines a serial local procedure with a nearest neighbor relaxation
process. By controlling overhead and reducing inter-processor communication
this method attains good performance and speed-up. The complexity and scaling
properties of the algorithm are analyzed.
  The algorithm has been used to simulate large 2d Ising systems (up to 27808 X
27808 sites) with Swendsen-Wang dynamics. Typical updating times on the order
of 82 nanosecs/site and efficiencies larger than 90% have been obtained using
256 processors on the CM-5 supercomputer.

quark-gluon condensate to mesonic correlators are calculated for the first time
to all orders in the quark masses, and to lowest order in the strong coupling
constant. Existing results on the coefficient functions of the unit operator
and the gluon condensate are reviewed. The proper factorization of short- and
long-distance contributions in the operator product expansion is discussed in
detail. It is found that to accomplish this task rigorously the operator
product expansion has to be performed in terms of non-normal-ordered
condensates. The resulting coefficient functions are improved with the help of
the renormalization group. The scale invariant combination of dimension 5
operators, including mixing with the mass operator, which is needed for the
renormalization group improvement, is calculated in the leading order.

radii $R_0$ and expand with velocity $v$. If $v$ is subsonic, a bubble becomes
unstable to non-spherical perturbations when its radius is roughly $10^4\,
R_0$. These perturbations accelerate the transition, and the effective velocity
of bubble growth rapidly becomes supersonic. The transition should subsequently
proceed spherically via detonation. If for some reason the onset of detonation
is postponed, the surface area of the bubbles may be enhanced by $10^5$. We
discuss consequences for electroweak baryogenesis.

D-dimensional matrix model recently proposed by Kazakov and Migdal. Among the
operators considered are ``filled Wilson loops"" which are the most reasonable
counterparts of Wilson loops in the conventional Wilson formulation of lattice
QCD. The averages of interest are represented as partition functions of certain
2-dimensional statistical systems with nearest neighbor interactions. The
``string tension"" $\alpha'$, which is the exponent in the area law for the
``filled Wilson loop"" is equal to the free energy density of the corresponding
statistical system. The continuum limit of the Kazakov--Migdal model
corresponds to the critical point of this statistical system. We argue that in
the large $N$ limit this critical point occurs at zero temperature. In this
case we express $\alpha'$ in terms of the distribution density of eigenvalues
of the matrix-valued master field. We show that the properties of the continuum
limit and the description of how this limit is approached is very unusual and
differs drastically from what occurs in both the Wilson theory ($S\propto({\rm
Tr}\prod U +{\rm c.c.})$) and in the ``adjoint'' theory ($S\propto\vert{\rm
Tr}\prod U\vert^2$). Instead, the continuum limit of the model appears to be
intriguingly similar to a $c>1$ string theory.
