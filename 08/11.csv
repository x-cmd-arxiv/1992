conductivity for the Hubbard model on a simple hypercubic lattice in infinite
dimensions. Our results for the paramagnetic phase display the features
expected from an intuitive analysis of the one-particle spectra and
substantiate the similarity of the physics of the Hubbard model to those of
heavy fermion systems. The calculations were performed using an approximate
solution to the single-impurity Anderson model, which is the key quantity
entering the solution of the Hubbard model in this limit. To establish the
quality of this approximation we compare its results, together with those
obtained from two other widely used methods, to essentially exact quantum Monte
Carlo results.

the direction of the point mass exactly as if the point mass itself were
charged. The conical space-time geometry also affects the zero point
fluctuations of a quantum scalar field leading to the existence of a vacuum
polarisation --- $\langle T_\mn \rangle$, in the 2+1 dimensional analog of the
Schwarzschild metric. The resulting linearised semi-classical Einstein
equations --- $G_\mn = 8 \pi G \langle T_\mn \rangle$, possess a well defined
Newtonian limit, in marked contrast to the classical case for which no
Newtonian limit is known to exist. An elegant reformulation of our results in
terms of the method of images is also presented.
  Our analysis also covers the non-static de Sitter--Schwarzschild metric in
2+1 dimensions, in which in addition to the vacuum polarisation, a non-zero
vacuum flux ofenergy -- $\langle T_{rt} \rangle $ is also found to exist.As

The approach involves using the BV formalism -- in a way suggested by recent
developments in closed-string field theory -- to implicitly define a gauge
invariant Lagrangian in a hypothetical ``space of all open-string world-sheet
theories.'' It is built into the formalism that classical solutions of the
string field theory are BRST invariant open-string world-sheet theories and
that, when expanding around a classical solution, the infinitesimal gauge
transformations are generated by the world-sheet BRST operator.

topologically twisted, to yield a formulation of topological gravity in four
dimensions. The topological BRST complex is just a rearrangement of the old
BRST complex, that partly modifies the role of physical and ghost fields:
indeed, the new ghost number turns out to be the sum of the old ghost number
plus the internal U(1) charge. Furthermore, the action of N=2 supergravity is
retrieved from topological gravity by choosing a gauge fixing that reduces the
space of physical states to the space of gravitational instanton
configurations, namely to self-dual spin connections. The descent equations
relating the topological observables are explicitly exhibited and discussed.
Ours is a first step in a programme that aims at finding the topological sector
of matter coupled N=2 supergravity, viewed as the effective Lagrangian of type
II superstrings and, as such, already related to 2D topological field-theories.
As it stands the theory we discuss may prove useful in describing gravitational
instantons moduli-spaces.

Moreover, the numerical results indicate a remarkable universality in the
influence on the geometry of surfaces due to the interaction with matter. For
spin systems this influence only depends on the total central charge.
