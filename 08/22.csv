analyzed. We compute the Wilson loops in the strong coupling phase, but we do
not find the $Z_N$ symmetry breaking, for arbitrary potential. We suggest to
bypass this problem by adding to the model a heavy fermion field in a
fundamental representation of $ SU(N) $. Remarkably, the model still can be
solved exactly by the Rieman-Hilbert method, for arbitrary number $N_f$ of
flavors. At $ N_f \ll N \rightarrow \infty $ there is a new regime, with two
vacuum densities. The $Z_N$ symmetry breaking density satisfies the linear
integral equation, with the kernel, depending upon the old density. The
symmetry breaking requires certain eigenvalue condition, which takes some extra
parameter adjustment of the scalar potential.

scales, leads to excessive pairwise velocity dispersions on small scales. In an
attempt to circumvent this problem, we study three scenarios (all with
$\Omega=1$) which have more large-scale power and less small-scale power than
the CDM model: 1) an admixture of cold and hot dark matter; 2) cold dark matter
with a non-scale-invariant, power-law primordial power spectrum; and 3) cold
dark matter with coupling of dark matter to a long-range vector field. Despite
the {reduced} small-scale power, when such models are evolved in the nonlinear
regime to large amplitude, the velocities on small scales are actually {\it
increased} over CDM with the same value of $\sigma_8$. This `flip-over', in
disagreement with the expectation from linear perturbation theory, arises from
the nonlinear coupling of the extra power on large scales with shorter
wavelengths. However, due to the extra large-scale power, the recent COBE DMR
results indicate smaller amplitudes for these models, $\sigma_8 \sim 0.5 -
0.7$, than for CDM (for which $\sigma_8 \sim 1.2$). Therefore, when normalized
to COBE on large scales, such models do lead to reduced velocities on small
scales and they produce fewer halos compared with CDM. Quantitatively it seems,
however, that models that produce sufficiently low small-scale velocities fail
to produce an adequate distribution of halos.

QCD. We present a detailed description of the simplest one dimensional
{($d$$=$$1$)} model which supports the hypothesis of wide applicability of the
mean--field approximation for the scalar fields and the existence of critical
behaviour in the model when the scalar action is Gaussian. Despite the
ocurrence of various non--trivial types of critical behaviour in the $d=1$
model as $N\rightarrow\infty$, only the conventional large-$N$ limit is
relevant for its {\it continuum} limit. We also give a mean--field analysis of
the $N=2$ model in {\it any} $d$ and show that a saddle point always exists in
the region $m^2>m_{\rm crit}^2(=d)$. In $d=1$ it exhibits critical behaviour as
$m^2\rightarrow m_{\rm crit}^2$. However when $d$$>$$1$ there is no critical
behaviour unless non--Gaussian terms are added to the scalar field action. We
argue that similar behaviour should occur for any finite $N$ thus providing a
simple explanation of a recent result of D. Gross. We show that critical
behaviour at $d$$>$$1$ and $m^2>m^2_{\rm crit}$ can be obtained by adding a
$logarithmic$ term to the scalar potential. This is equivalent to a local
modification of the integration measure in the original Kazakov--Migdal model.
Experience from previous studies of the Generalized Kontsevich Model implies
that, unlike the inclusion of higher powers in the potential, this minor
modification should not substantially alter the behaviour of the Gaussian
model.
