strongly localized at boundaries are studied analytically and numerically. The
exponential decay of the wavefunction is modulated by a field dependent
amplitude J(t) which depends sensitively on the value of alpha (the magnetic
flux per plaquette in units of a flux quantum, t is the distance from the
boundary). While for rational values p/q, the envelope of J(t) increases as
2**t/q, the behavior for irrational alpha is erratic with an aperiodic
structure which changes drastically with alpha. For algebraic alpha it is found
that J(t) increases as a power law t**b(alpha) while it grows faster for
transcendental alpha. This is very different from the growth rate exp{sqrt(t)}
typical for random phases. The theoretical analysis is extended to lattices in
which the distances between adjacent layers increase as r**n with n>0.
Different behavior of J(t;n) is found in various regimes of n. It changes from
periodic for small n to random like for large n.
