  available upon request",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.47.13353",,"cond-mat",,"  The structural and electronic properties of cubic GaN are studied within the
local density approximation by the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbitals
method. The Ga $3d$ electrons are treated as band states, and no shape
approximation is made to the potential and charge density. The influence of $d$
electrons on the band structure, charge density, and bonding properties is
analyzed. It is found that due to the energy resonance of the Ga 3$d$ states
with nitrogen 2$s$ states, the cation $d$ bands are not inert, and features
unusual for a III-V compound are found in the lower part of the valence band
and in the valence charge density and density of states. To clarify the
influence of the Ga $d$ states on the cohesive properties, additional full and
frozen--overlapped-core calculations were performed for GaN, cubic ZnS, GaAs,
and Si. The results show, in addition to the known importance of non-linear
core-valence exchange-correlation corrections, that an explicit description of
closed-shell repulsion effects is necessary to obtain accurate results for GaN
and similar systems. In summary, GaN appears to be somewhat exceptional among
the III-V compounds and reminiscent of II-VI materials, in that its band
structure and cohesive properties are sensitive to a proper treatment of the
cation $d$ bands, as a result of the presence of the latter in the valence band
range.

contrast to our earlier work on the subject we have chosen here {\it not} to
integrate out the gauge fields but to keep them in the Monte Carlo simulation.
This allows us to measure observables associated with the gauge fields and
thereby address the problem of the local $Z_2$ symmetry present in the model.
We confirm our previous result that the model has a line of first order phase
transitions terminating in a critical point. The adjoint plaquette has a clear
discontinuity across the phase transition, whereas the plaquette in the
fundamental representation is always zero in accordance with Elitzur's theorem.
The density of small $Z_2$ monopoles shows very little variation and is always
large. We also find that the model has extra local U(1) symmetries which do not
exist in the case of the standard adjoint theory. As a result, we are able to
show that two of the angles parameterizing the gauge field completely decouple
from the theory and the continuum limit defined around the critical point can
therefore not be `QCD'.

degeneracy of states. The statistical mechanics of a gas of black p-branes is
then analyzed in the microcanonical ensemble. As in the case of black holes,
the equilibrium state is not thermal and the stable configuration is the one
for which a single black object carries most of the energy. Again, neutral
black p-branes obey the bootstrap condition and it is then possible to argue
that their scattering amplitudes satisfy crossing symmetry. Finally, arguments
identifying quantum black p-branes with ordinary quantum branes of different
dimensionality are presented.

fermions: chiral, Kogut--Susskind and Wilson ones. Using the mean field method
we show that a first order large-N phase transition occurs with decreasing
fermion mass. We conclude, therefore, that adjoint fermions induce QCD. We draw
the same conclusion for the adjoint scalar or fermion models at large number of
flavors N_f when they induce a single-plaquette lattice gauge theory. We find
an exact strong coupling solution for the adjoint fermion model and show it is
quite similar to that for the Kazakov--Migdal model with the quadratic
potential. We discuss the possibility for the adjoint fermion model to be
solvable at N_c=\infty in the weak coupling region where the Wilson loops obey
normal area law.

deformation of one-dimensional $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
Resulting physical systems do not have conserved charges and degeneracies in
the spectra. Instead, superpartner Hamiltonians are $q$-isospectral, i.e. the
spectrum of one can be obtained from another (with possible exception of the
lowest level) by $q^2$-factor scaling. This construction allows easily to
rederive a special self-similar potential found by Shabat and to show that for
the latter a $q$-deformed harmonic oscillator algebra of Biedenharn and
Macfarlane serves as the spectrum generating algebra. A general class of
potentials related to the quantum conformal algebra $su_q(1,1)$ is described.
Further possibilities for $q$-deformation of known solvable potentials are
outlined.
