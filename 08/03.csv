dependence of the elastic moduli for several ordered structures in the
Aluminum-Lithium system, specifically FCC Al, FCC and BCC Li, L1_2 Al_3Li, and
an ordered FCC Al_7Li supercell. The calculations were performed using the full
potential linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) to calculate the total
energy as a function of strain, after which the data was fit to a polynomial
function of the strain to determine the modulus. A procedure for estimating the
errors in this process is also given. The predicted equilibrium lattice
parameters are slightly smaller than found experimentally, consistent with
other LDA calculations. The computed elastic moduli are within approximately
10% of the experimentally measured moduli, provided the calculations are
carried out at the experimental lattice constant. The LDA equilibrium shear
modulus C11-C12 increases from 59.3 GPa in Al, to 76.0 GPa in Al_7Li, to 106.2
GPa in Al_3Li. The modulus C_44 increases from 38.4 GPa in Al to 46.1 GPa in
Al_7Li, then falls to 40.7 GPa in Al_3Li. All of the calculated elastic moduli
increase with pressure with the exception of BCC Li, which becomes elastically
unstable at about 2 GPa, where C_11-C_12 vanishes.

algebras. It is also known that groups and Hopf algebras (quantum groups) lead
to classical and quantum diffusions. We study here the more primitive notion of
a quantum random walk associated to a general Hopf algebra and show that it has
a simple physical interpretation in quantum mechanics. This is by means of a
representation theorem motivated from the theory of Kac algebras: If $H$ is any
Hopf algebra, it may be realised in $\Lin(H)$ in such a way that $\Delta
h=W(h\tens 1)W^{-1}$ for an operator $W$. This $W$ is interpreted as the time
evolution operator for the system at time $t$ coupled quantum-mechanically to
the system at time $t+\delta$. Finally, for every Hopf algebra there is a dual
one, leading us to a duality operation for quantum random walks and quantum
diffusions and a notion of the coentropy of an observable. The dual system has
its time reversed with respect to the original system, leading us to a CTP-type
theorem.

the corresponding Zamalodchikov algebra. We develop this interpretation in
detail, distinguishing between two forms of this algebra, $V(R)$ (vectors) and
$V^*(R)$ (covectors). $A(R)\to V(R_{21})\tens V^*(R)$ is an algebra
homomorphism (i.e. quantum matrices are realized by the tensor product of a
quantum vector with a quantum covector), while the inner product of a quantum
covector with a quantum vector transforms as a scaler. We show that if $V(R)$
and $V^*(R)$ are endowed with the necessary braid statistics $\Psi$ then their
braided tensor-product $V(R)\und\tens V^*(R)$ is a realization of the braided
matrices $B(R)$ introduced previously, while their inner product leads to an
invariant quantum trace. Introducing braid statistics in this way leads to a
fully covariant quantum (braided) linear algebra. The braided groups obtained
from $B(R)$ act on themselves by conjugation in a way impossible for the
quantum groups obtained from $A(R)$.

have the same FRT generators $l^\pm$ but a matrix braided-coproduct $\und\Delta
L=L\und\tens L$ where $L=l^+Sl^-$, and are self-dual. As an application, the
degenerate Sklyanin algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the braided matrices
$BM_q(2)$; it is a braided-commutative bialgebra in a braided category. As a
second application, we show that the quantum double $D(\usl)$ (also known as
the `quantum Lorentz group') is the semidirect product as an algebra of two
copies of $\usl$, and also a semidirect product as a coalgebra if we use braid
statistics. We find various results of this type for the doubles of general
quantum groups and their semi-classical limits as doubles of the Lie algebras
of Poisson Lie groups.
