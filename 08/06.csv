infinite spatial dimensions are presented. At half filling we observe a gradual
crossover from a normal Fermi-liquid with a Drude peak at $\omega=0$ in the
optical conductivity to an insulator as a function of $U$ for temperatures
above the antiferromagnetic phase transition. When doped, the ``insulator''
becomes a Fermi-liquid with a corresponding temperature dependence of the
optical conductivity and resistivity. We find a $T^2$-coefficient in the low
temperature resistivity which suggests that the carriers in the system acquire
a considerable mass-enhancement due to the strong local correlations. At high
temperatures, a crossover into a semi-metallic regime takes place.

expansion. To relate the physical quantity to Monte Carlo data one has to know
the renormalization coefficient, $Z$, between the lattice operators and their
continuum counterparts. We come back to this computation to resolve
discrepancies found in previous calculations. We define and discuss in detail
the renormalization procedure that allows the (perturbative) computation of
$Z$. Comparing the one-loop calculations in the effective Lagrangian approach
with the direct two-loop calculation of the two-point $B$-meson correlator in
the limit of large $b$-quark mass, we prove that the two schemes give
consistent results to order $\alpha_s$. We show that there is, however, a
renormalization prescription ambiguity that can have sizeable numerical
consequences. This ambiguity can be resolved in the framework of an $O(a)$
improved calculation, and we describe the correct prescription in that case.
Finally we give the numerical values of $Z$ that correspond to the different
types of lattice approximations discussed in the paper.

the light of present precision electroweak measurements. Two necessary features
of this model are that the tau lifetime should be longer than predicted by the
standard model and that the rho parameter measured at the Z peak should have an
additional negative contribution. Both trends are noticeable in present data. A
future decisive test of this model would be the discovery of new W and Z bosons
with nearly degenerate masses of a few TeV.

their properties are investigated. They represent a nontrivial generalization
of the spining $CS$ of the $SU(2)$ group. The $CS$ are parametrized by the
points of the coset space, which is, in that particular case, the projective
space $CP^{N-1}$ and plays the role of the phase space of a corresponding
classical mechanics. The $CS$ possess of a minimum uncertainty, they minimize
an invariant dispersion of the quadratic Casimir operator. The classical limit
is ivestigated in terms of symbols of operators. The role of the Planck
constant playes $h=P^{-1}$, where $P$ is the signature of the representation.
The classical limit of the so called star commutator generates the Poisson
bracket in the $CP^{N-1}$ phase space. The logarithm of the modulus of the $CS$
overlapping, being interpreted as a symmetric in the space, gives the
Fubini-Study metric in $CP^{N-1}$. The $CS$ constructed are useful for the
quasi-classical analysis of the quantum equations of the $SU(N)$ gauge
symmetric theories.

formulated in terms of actions possessing either local world-line supersymmetry

by adding a finite number of spinor or vector coordinates to the usual
space-time coordinates. Generalizing to superspace leads to corresponding types
of \lq spinning superparticle' theories in which the wave-functions are
superfields in some (generally reducible) representation of the Lorentz group.
A class of these spinning superparticle actions possesses the same spectrum as
ten-dimensional supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory, which it is shown can be
formulated in terms of either vector or spinor superfields satisfying
supercovariant constraints. The models under consideration include some that
were known previously and some new ones.
