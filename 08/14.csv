coarse-grained free quantum fields in an inflationary Universe. The appropriate
stochastic quantum Liouville equation is derived. Explicit solutions for the
phase space quantum distribution function are found for the cases of power law
and exponential expansions. The expectation values of dynamical variables with
respect to these solutions are compared to the corresponding cutoff regularized
field theoretic results (we do not restrict ourselves only to $\VEV{\F^2}$).
Fair agreement is found provided the coarse-graining scale is kept within
certain limits. By focusing on the full phase space distribution function
rather than a reduced distribution it is shown that the thermodynamic
interpretation of the stochastic formalism faces several difficulties (e.g.,
there is no fluctuation-dissipation theorem). The coarse-graining does not
guarantee an automatic classical limit as quantum correlations turn out to be
crucial in order to get results consistent with standard quantum field theory.
Therefore, the method does {\em not} by itself constitute an explanation of the
quantum to classical transition in the early Universe. In particular, we argue
that the stochastic equations do not lead to decoherence.

self-couplings we calculated the cross sections for the two and three gauge
boson production processes in $e^+e^-$ collisions. Measurements of these cross

corrections are included, the mass of the $CP=+1$ lightest Higgs boson is
bounded by $\sim 110\ GeV$ for $m_t < 150\ GeV$ and a scale of supersymmetry
breaking $\sim\ 1\ TeV$. In non-minimal supersymmetric standard models (NMSSM)
upper bounds on the mass of the corresponding scalar Higgs boson arise if the
theory is required to remain perturbative up to scales $\gg G_F^{-1/2}$. We
have computed those bounds for two illustrative NMSSM: i) A model with an
arbitrary number of gauge singlets; ii) A model with three $SU(2)_L$ triplets
with $Y=0,\pm 1$. We have integrated numerically the corresponding
renormalization group equations (RGE), including the top and bottom quark
Yukawa couplings, and added one-loop radiative corrections. For $m_t > 91\ GeV$
the absolute bounds are $\sim 140\ GeV$ for both models.

random surfaces. Both amplitudes coinside in the case, when the surface
degenarates into a single particle world line. We extend the model to open
surfaces as well. The boundary contribution is proportional to the full length
of the boundary and the coefficient of proportionality can be treated as a
hopping parameter of the quarks. In the limit, when this parameter tends to
infinity, the theory is essentialy simlplified. We prove that the contribution
of a given triangulation to the partition function is finite and have found the
explicit form for the upper bound. The question of the convergence of the full
partition function remains open. In this model the string tension may vanish at
the critical point, if the last one exists, and possess a nontrivial scaling
limit. The model contains hidden fermionic variables and can be considered as
an independent model of hadrons.
