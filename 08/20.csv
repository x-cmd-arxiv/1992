closed field $k$. In the case when $k$ is of characteristic zero, C. Widland
and the second author have defined Weierstrass points of a line bundle on $X$.
In the first section, this definition is extended to linear systems in
arbitrary characteristic. This definition may be viewed as a generalization of
the definitions of Laksov and St\""ohr-Voloch to the Gorenstein case. In the
second section, an example is given to illustrate the definition. This example
is a plane curve of arithmetic genus 3 in characteristic 2 such that the gap
sequence at every smooth point (with respect to the dualizing bundle) is 1,2,5
and there are no smooth Weierstrass points. In the third section, the
Weierstrass weight of a unibranch singularity (on a not necessarily rational
curve) is computed in terms of its semigroup of values. In the final section,
the Weierstrass weight of a singularity with precisely two branches (again
assuming that the characteristic is zero) is computed.

to categories of topology and topological algebra. Among them are free
topological groups, free locally convex spaces, free Banach-Lie algebras, and
much more. An accent is put on relationship of those constructions with other
areas of mathematics and their possible applications. A number of open problems
is discussed; some of them belong to universal arrow theory, and others may
hopefully become amenable to methods of this theory.

of interest in cosmology the entropy in both density perturbations and
gravitational waves exceeds the entropy of statistical fluctuations of the
microwave background. The nonequilibrium entropy discussed here is a measure of
loss of information about the system. We discuss the origin of the entropy in
our cosmological models and compare the definition of entropy in terms of
correlation functions with the microcanonical definition in quantum statistical

spin $S_{ijk} = \pm 1$ to each triplet of distinct sites $i,j$ and $k$. The
dual interaction energy reads $-\sum _{(ij)} D_{ij} \prod _{k \neq i,j}
