"astro-ph/9208006",,"Sandip K. Chakrabarti (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay,
  INDIA)","Binary Black Holes in Stationary Orbits","ApJ (Submitted)",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  We show that under certain astrophysical conditions a binary system
consisting of two compact objects can be stabilized against indefinite
shrinking of orbits due to the emission of gravitational radiation. In this
case, the lighter binary companion settles down to a stable orbit when the loss
of the angular momentum due to gravitational radiation becomes equal to its
gain from the accreting matter from the disk around the more massive primary.
We claim that such systems can be stable against small perturbations and can be
regarded as steady emitters of gravitational waves of constant frequency and
amplitude. Furthermore, X-rays emitted by the secondary can also produce
astrophysically interesting situations when coupled with gravitational lensing
and Doppler effects.

background (cmb) anisotropy measured by COBE. Vacuum fluctuations during
inflation generate an adiabatic density perturbation, and also gravitational
waves. The ratio of these two contributions to the cmb anisotropy is given for
an arbitrary slow-roll inflaton potential. Results from the IRAS/QDOT and
POTENT galaxy surveys are used to normalise the spectrum of the density
perturbation on the scale $20h^{-1}\Mpc$, so that the COBE measurement on the
scale $10^3h^{-1}\Mpc$ provides a lower bound on the spectral index $n$. For
`power law' and `extended' inflation, gravitational waves are significant and
the bound is $n>0.84$ at the $2$-sigma level. For `natural' inflation,
gravitational waves are negligible and the constraint is weakened to $n>0.70$,
at best marginally consistent with a recent proposal for explaining the excess
clustering observed in the APM galaxy survey. Many versions of extended
inflation, including those based on the Brans--Dicke theory, are ruled out,
because they require $n\lsim 0.75$ in order that bubbles formed at the end of
inflation should not be observed now in the cmb.

first model independent insight to the shape of the quark distribution in the
baryon ground state. As in our octet baryon analysis, the lattice results give
evidence of spin-dependent forces and mass effects in the electromagnetic
properties. The quark charge distribution radii indicate these effects act in
opposing directions. Some baryon dependence of the effective quark magnetic
moments is seen. However, this dependence in decuplet baryons is more subtle
than that for octet baryons. Of particular interest are the lattice predictions
for the magnetic moments of $\Omega^-$ and $\Delta^{++}$ for which new recent
experimental measurements are available. The lattice prediction of the
$\Delta^{++}/p$ ratio appears larger than the experimental ratio, while the
lattice prediction for the $\Omega^-/p$ magnetic moment ratio is in good
agreement with the experimental ratio.

a charmed-quark-antiquark pair in a color-octet S-wave state to radiate a soft
