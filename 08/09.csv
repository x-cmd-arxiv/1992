superstring derived standard--like model. I argue that nonrenormalizable terms
restrict the gauge symmetry, at the Planck scale, to be $SU(3)\times
SU(2)\times U(1)_{B-L}\times U(1)_{T_{3_R}}$ rather than $SU(3)\times
SU(2)\times U(1)_Y$. I show that breaking the gauge symmetry directly to the
Standard Model leads to breaking of supersymmetry at the Planck scale, or to
dimension four, baryon and lepton violating, operators. I show that if the
gauge symmetry is broken directly to the Standard Model the cubic level
solution to the F and D flatness constraints is violated by higher order terms,
while if $U(1)_{Z^\prime}$ remains unbroken at the Planck scale, the cubic
level solution is valid to all orders of nonrenormalizable terms. I discuss the
Higgs and fermion mass spectrum. I demonstrate that realistic, hierarchical,
fermion mass spectrum can be generated in this model.

models in the four dimensional free fermionic formulation. The analysis results
in a restricted class of models with unique characteristics: (i) Three and only
three generations of chiral fermions with their superpartners and the correct
Standard Model quantum numbers. (ii) Proton decay from dimension four and
dimension five operators is suppressed due to gauged $U(1)$ symmetries. (iii)
There exist Higgs doublets from two distinct sectors, which can generate
realistic symmetry breaking. (iv) These models explain the top--bottom mass
hierarchy. At the trilinear level of the superpotential only the top quark gets
a non vanishing mass term. The bottom quark and the lighter quarks and leptons
get their mass terms from non renormalizable terms. This result is correlated
with the requirement of a supersymmetric vacuum at the Planck scale. (v) The
models predict the existence of small hidden gauge groups, like $SU(3)$, with
matter spectrum in vector representations.
