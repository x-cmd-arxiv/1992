action in simulations of non-abelian lattice gauge theory. The idea, called
`extremization', is to minimize $\int(\dl S/\dl A_\mu)^2$. The method was
implemented in an explicitly gauge variant way, however, and gauge dependence
showed up in the results.
  Here we show how extremization can be formulated in a way that preserves
gauge invariance on the lattice. The method applies to any gauge group and any
lattice action. The procedure is worked out in detail for the standard
plaquette action with gauge groups U(1) and SU(N).

left-right symmetric model. We explore the prospect of such heavy Right-handed
Neutrino search Via $W_R$ decay in the Like Sign Dilepton channel at SSC/LHC.
The standard model background can be effectively eliminated by suitable lepton
$p_T$ and isolation cuts without affecting the signal cross section seriously.
In this way it seems possible to explore the bulk of the parameter space $0 <
M_{N_R} < M_{W_R}$, with $M_{W_R}$ going upto 3000 (2000) GeV at SSC (LHC)
energy.

interacting with $c < 1$ matter. We define CMM as solutions to (discrete)
extended Virasoro constraints. We argue that the so defined alternatives of
multi-matrix models represent the same universality classes in continuum limit,
while at the discrete level they provide explicit solutions to the
multi-component KP hierarchy and by definition satisfy the discrete
$W$-constraints. We prove that discrete CMM coincide with the $(p,q)$-series of
2d gravity models in a {\it well}-{\it defined} continuum limit, thus
demonstrating that they provide a proper generalization of Hermitian one-matrix
model.
