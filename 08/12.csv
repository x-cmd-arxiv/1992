neutrino, the photons would distort the microwave background radiation through
ionization of the universe. The constraint on the branching ratio of such
decays from COBE measurements is found to be more stringent than that from
other considerations. The limit on the branching ratio in terms of the Compton
$y$ parameter is $B_\gamma < 1.5 \times 10^{-7} ({\tau_\nu \over 10^{11}

the existence of two-channel Kondo interactions between conduction electrons
and the low energy degrees of freedom on U$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ in a metal
host, assuming that the underlying microscopics are regulated by the Anderson
Hamiltonian. An additional dynamic selection rule is imposed on Ce$^{3+}$ ions.
The selection rules restrict the two-channel quadrupolar Kondo effect to
U$^{4+}$ ions in cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal symmetry. For hexagonal and
tetragonal symmetry, the Kondo effect for a U$^{4+}$ ion will always be
quadrupolar. The selection rules for Ce$^{3+}$ ions restrict the two-channel
magnetic Kondo effect to one of three possible doublet ionic ground states in
hexagonal symmetry and the lone doublet ionic ground state in cubic symmetry.
The dynamical selection rule apparently excludes two-channel Kondo behavior for
Yb$^{3+}$ ions.

covariant and complies with geometrical constructions of the topological charge

Workshop on QCD Vacuum Structure. We report on the status of quark and gluon
propagators in quenched, gaugefixed lattice QCD. In Landau gauge we find that
the effective quark mass in the chiral limit is $M_q \sim 350(40)MeV$. Quark
and gluon propagators, the slope of the quark dispersion relation, and
effective masses all appear to depend on gauge. A link-chain picture of lattice
gaugefixing in the color $N\to\infty$ and strong coupling limit, where the
system becomes almost solvable, supports the gauge variance of these numerical
results. Subscribers will be given one Postscript file, the Figure included.

Skyrme model, where they are treated as bound states of a heavy meson with an
$SU(2)$ chiral soliton. In the large $N_c$ limit, the baryon spectrum is an
infinite tower of degenerate states with isospin and spin of the light degrees
of freedom $I=s_\ell=0,1,2,\dots$, and total spin $s=\abs{s_\ell\pm1/2}$.
Exotic states with no quark model analogues in the large $N_c$ limit are found
to be unbound. The $\Sigma_c-\Lambda_c$ mass difference is computed and found
to be in good agreement with experiment. The $\Sigma_c\,\Sigma_c\,\pi$ and
$\Sigma_c\,\Lambda_c\,\pi$ coupling constants are calculated to leading order
in $N_c$ in terms of $g_A$, the axial coupling constant of the nucleon. We
discuss the extension of our results to $SU(3)$ chiral solitons.
