tunneling of magnetization direction is spin-parity dependent: it vanishes for
magnetic particles with half-integer spin, but is allowed for integer spin. A
coherent-state path integral calculation shows that this topological effect
results from interference between tunneling paths.

topology $R^3 XS^1$ arise naturally in any discussion of finite temperature
quantum gravity. This Letter shows that all such instantons (irrespective of
their interior behaviour) must have the same asymptotic structure as the
Schwarzschild instanton. Using this, it can be shown that if the Ricci tensor
of the manifold is non-negative it must be flat. One special case is when the
Ricci tensor vanishes; hence one can conclude that there is no nontrivial
vacuum gravitational instanton. This result has uses both in quantum and
classical gravity. It places a significant restriction on the instabilities of
hot flat space. It also can be used to show that any static vacuum Lorentzian
Kaluza-Klein solution is flat.

trapped surfaces in spherically symmetric initial data defined on a closed
manifold. Such trapped surfaces surround a region in which there occurs an
enhancement of matter over the average. The conditions are posed directly in
terms of physical variables and show that what one needs is a relatively large
amount of excess matter confined to a small volume. The expansion of the
universe and an outward flow of matter oppose the formation of trapped
surfaces; an inward flow of matter helps. The model can be regarded as a
Friedmann-Lema\^\i tre-Walker cosmology with localized spherical
inhomogeneities. We show that the total excess mass cannot be too large.

critical phenomena in 3 spatial dimensions. The theory with the
$\varepsilon$-corrected potential exhibits much larger fluctuations in the
spatial correlations of the order parameter, considerably weakening the
strength of the transition.

Generalized Kontsevich Model can be presented as a product of some
``quasiclassical'' factor and non-deformed partition function which depends
only on the sum of Miwa transformed and flat times. This result is important
for the restoration of explicit $p-q$ symmetry in the interpolation pattern
between all the $(p,q)$-minimal string models with $c<1$ and for revealing its
integrable structure in $p$-direction, determined by deformations of the
potential. It also implies the way in which supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg
models are embedded into the general context of GKM. From the point of view of
integrable theory these deformations present a particular case of what is
called equivalent hierarchies.
