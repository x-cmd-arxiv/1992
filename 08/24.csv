theories based on the simply-laced affine algebras. By considering
automorphisms of the simply-laced Dynkin diagrams, solutions to the remaining
algebras, twisted as well as untwisted, are deduced.

by evaluating the trace of the regulated path integral jacobian matrix, as
shown by Fujikawa. In 1983, Alvarez-Gaum\'e and Witten observed that one can
simplify this evaluation by replacing the operators which appear in the
regulator and in the jacobian by quantum mechanical operators with the same
(anti)commutation relations. By rewriting this quantum mechanical trace as a
path integral with periodic boundary conditions for a one-dimensional
supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model, they obtained the chiral anomalies for
spin 1/2 and 3/2 fields and selfdual antisymmetric tensors in d dimensions. In
this article, we treat the case of trace anomalies for spin 0, 1/2 and 1 fields
in a gravitational and Yang-Mills background. We do not introduce a
supersymmetric sigma model, but keep the original Dirac matrices $\g^\m$ and
internal symmetry generators $T^a$ in the path integral. As a result, we get a
matrix-valued action. Gauge covariance of the path integral then requires a
definition of the exponential of the action by time-ordering. We exponentiate
the factors $\sqrt g$ in the path integral measure by using vector ghosts in
order to exhibit the cancellation of the sigma model divergences more clearly.
We compute the trace anomalies in d=2 and d=4.
