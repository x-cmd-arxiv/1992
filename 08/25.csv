minutes of inspiral and final coalescence of neutron star and black hole
binaries at distances approaching cosmological, where the event rate may be
many per year. Because the binary's accumulated orbital phase can be measured
to a fractional accuracy $\ll 10^{-3}$ and relativistic effects are large, the
waveforms will be far more complex, carry more information, and be far harder
to model theoretically than has been expected. Theorists must begin now to lay
a foundation for extracting the waves' information.

action has a similar structure as that of a massless relativistic particle. The
former is naturally generalized by adding a term analogous to a mass term of
the relativistic particle. The new action possesses a constant parameter
regarded as a kind of a cosmological constant. It is interesting to find a
covariant Einstein equation from the action. In order to do it we will examine
how the geometrical quantities are determined from the non-metric action and
how the Einstein equation follows from it.

Z-string will be unstable even under the conditions present during the
electroweak phase transition. We then consider phenomenologically viable models
based on the gauge group $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ and show
that metastable strings exist and are stable to small perturbations for a large
region of the parameter space for these models. We also show that these strings
are superconducting with bosonic charge carriers. The string superconductivity
may be able to stabilize segments and loops against dynamical contraction.

We propose that the gamma-ray bursters (GRBs) are examples of these naked

involving spherically symmetric collapse of pure radiation field, the energy
$E_\gamma$ and the observed duration $\Delta t_o$ of a GRB should satisfy,

quantum description of anyons and vortices in: a) the Maxwell theory; b) the

Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs theory. A careful construction of a charge bearing
order operator($\sigma$) and a magnetic flux bearing disorder operator (vortex
operator) ($\mu$) is performed, paying attention to the necessary requirements
for locality. An anyon operator is obtained as the product $\varphi=\sigma\mu$.
A detailed and comprehensive study of the euclidean correlation functions of
$\sigma$, $\mu$ and $\varphi$ is carried on in the four theories above. The
exact correlation functions are obtained in cases $\underline{a}$ and
$\underline{c}$. The large distance behavior of them is obtained in cases
$\underline{b}$ and $\underline{d}$. The study of these correlation functions
allows one to draw conclusions about the condensation of charge and magnetic
flux, establishing thereby an analogy with the Ising model. The mass of vortex
and anyon excitations is explicitly obtained wherever these excitations are
present in the spectrum. The independence between the mechanisms of mass
generation for the vortices and for the vector field is clearly exposed.
