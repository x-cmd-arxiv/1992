typically form fairly well defined bands in the energy space. We show that the
composite fermion theory gives insight into the origin of these bands and
provides an accurate and complete microscopic description of the strongly
correlated many-body states in the low-energy bands. Thus, somewhat like in
Landau's fermi liquid theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
low energy Hilbert space of strongly interacting electrons in the fractinal
quantum Hall regime and that of weakly interacting electrons in the integer
quantum Hall regime.

appropriate in a cosmological setting to describe the interaction of some
collective degree of freedom with a surrounding ``environment.'' Formally,
these equations are much more general, involving as they do a more or less
arbitrary ``system,'' characterized by some time-dependent potential, which is
coupled via a nonlinear, time-dependent interaction to a ``bath'' of
oscillators with time-dependent frequencies. The analysis reveals that, even in
a Markov limit, which can often be justified, the time dependences and
nonlinearities can induce new and potentially significant effects, such as
systematic and stochastic mass renormalizations and state-dependent ``memory''
functions, aside from the standard ``friction'' of a heuristic Langevin
description. One specific example is discussed in detail, namely the case of an
inflaton field, characterized by a Landau-Ginsburg potential, that is coupled
quadratically to a bath of scalar ``radiation.'' The principal conclusion
derived from this example is that nonlinearities and time-dependent couplings
do {\em not} preclude the possibility of deriving a fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, and do {\em not} change the form of the late-time steady state
solution for the system, but {\em can} significantly shorten the time scale for
the approach towards the steady state.

string action for the ten-dimensional Green-Schwarz superstring is quantized

gauge-fixed Green-Schwarz actions, the twistor-string action does not require
interaction-point operators at the zeroes of the light-cone momentum, $\dz
x^+$, which complicated all previous calculations. After defining the vertex
operator for the massless physical supermultiplet, as well as two
picture-changing operators and an instanton-number-changing operator,
scattering amplitudes for an arbitrary number of loops and external massless
states are explicitly calculated by evaluating free-field correlation functions
of these operators on N=2 super-Riemann surfaces of the appropriate topology,
and integrating over the global moduli. Although there is no sum over spin
structures, only discrete values of the global U(1) moduli contribute to the
amplitudes. Because the spacetime supersymmetry generators do not contain ghost
fields, the amplitudes are manifestly spacetime supersymmetric, there is no
multiloop ambiguity, and the non-renormalization theorem is easily proven. By
choosing the picture-changing operators to be located at the zeroes of $\dz
x^+$, these amplitudes are shown to agree with amplitudes obtained using the
manifestly unitary light-cone gauge formalism.
