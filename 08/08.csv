folded into regular polihedra is studied. A continuum limit valid for
sufficiently large molecules and based on a tight binding approximation is
derived. It is found that a Dirac equation describes the flat graphite lattice.
Curving the lattice by insertion of odd numbered rings can be mimicked by
coupling effective gauge fields. In particular the $C_{60}$ and related
molecules are well described by the Dirac equation on the surface of a sphere
coupled to a color monopole sitting at its center.

of topological solitons in nonlinear sigma models. Taking as space the
connected $d$-manifold $X$, and considering nonlinear sigma models with the
connected manifold $M$ as target space, topological solitons are given by
elements of $pi_d(M)$. Any topological soliton $\alpha \in \pi_d(M)$ determines
a quotient $\Stat_n(X,\alpha)$ of the group of framed braids on $X$, such that
choices of allowed statistics for solitons of type $\alpha$ are given by
unitary representations of $\Stat_n(X,\alpha)$ when $n$ solitons are present.
In particular, when $M = S^2$, as in the $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with Hopf
term, and $\alpha \in \pi_2(S^2)$ is a generator, we compute that
$\Stat_n(\R^2,\alpha) = \Z$, while $\Stat_n(S^2,\alpha) = \Z_{2n}$. It follows
that phase $\exp(i\theta)$ for interchanging two solitons of type $\alpha$ on
$S^2$ must satisfy the constraint $\theta = k\pi/n$, $k \in \Z$, when $n$ such
solitons are present.

dynamical Wilson quarks and Wilson valence quarks, at $6/{g^2}=5.3$. The
spectroscopy of these systems is essentially identical. Parameterizations of
the wave functions are presented which can be used as interpolating fields for
spectroscopy calculations. The sizes of particles are calculated using these
parameterized wave functions. The resulting sizes are small, approximately half
the sizes of the physical states. The charge radius of the neutron, which
provides an indication of the asymmetries between the wave functions of up and
down quarks, is calculated. Although the size of the nucleon in these
simulations is small, the ratio of the charge radius of the neutron to that of
the proton is consistent with the physical value. We find no significant
differences between the quenched and dynamical simulations.

finite-temperature phase transition in spontaneously-broken gauge theories
(including the standard model) must be be studied using a renormalization group
treatment. Previous studies within the $(4-\ep)$-expansion suggest a 1st-order
transition in this regime. We use analogies with experimentally accessible
phase transitions in liquid crystals, and theoretical investigations of
superconductor phase transitions to argue that, in this range, the critical
behavior of a large class of gauge-Higgs-fermion systems changes from 1st to
2nd-order as a function of Higgs mass. We identify a set of models which,
within the $(2+\ep)$-expansion, possess fixed points that can describe this
2nd-order behavior. As usual, a definitive demonstration that the claimed
critical behavior occurs (and a reliable estimate of $m_{\rm Higgs}$ at the
tricritical point) will probably require numerical simulations. This paper uses
the ``phyzzx'' macro package. To obtain figure contact the author.

coupled to 2d gravity. The problem of interpolation between different models is
discussed. It is found that this problem is closely connected with
``deformations'' within the set of solutions to KP hierarchy, described by a
sort of reparameterization of a spectral curve and change of asymptotics of the
basis in the Grassmannian. The $c \rightarrow 1$ limit is considered along this
line.
