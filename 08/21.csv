coupled GaAs/AlGaAs rings. The focusing in the single ring is attributed solely
to internal orbits. The focusing effect allows the ring to be used as a small
mass spectrometer. The focusing causes peaks in the magnetoresistance at low
fields, and the peak positions were used to study the dispersion relation of
the one-dimensional magnetoelectric subbands. The electron effective mass
increases with the applied magnetic field by a factor of $50$, at a magnetic
field of $0.5T$. This is the first time this increase has been measured
directly. General agreement obtains between the experiment and the subband
calculations for straight channels.

  SCRI-92-114",,"10.1063/1.43428",,"hep-lat hep-ph",,"  Older lattice work exploring the Higgs mass triviality bound is briefly
reviewed. It indicates that a strongly interacting scalar sector in the minimal
standard model cannot exist; on the other hand low energy QCD phenomenology
might be interpreted as an indication that it could. We attack this puzzle
using the $1/N$ expansion and discover a simple criterion for selecting a
lattice action that is more likely to produce a heavy Higgs particle. Depending
on the precise form of the limitation put on the cutoff effects, our large $N$
calculations, when combined with old numerical data, suggest that the Higgs
mass bound might be around 750 $GeV$, which is higher than the $\sim 650~GeV$
previously obtained. Preliminary numerical work indicates that an increase of
at least 19\% takes place at $N=4$ on the $F_4$ lattice when the old simple
action is replaced with a new action (still containing only nearest neighbor
interactions) if one uses the lattice spacing as the physical cutoff for both
actions. It appears that, while a QCD like theory could produce $M_H / F ~ \sim
6$, a meaningful ``minimal elementary Higgs'' theory cannot have $M_H/ F~
\gtapprox 3$. Still, even at 750 $GeV$, the Higgs particle is so wide ($\sim
290~$GeV), that one cannot argue any more that the scalar sector is weakly
coupled.

The computations are performed on a $24^3\times48$ lattice at $\beta = 6.2$,
using the same set of 18 gluon configurations for both fermion actions. We find
that the splitting is 1.83\err{13}{15} times larger with the clover action than
with the Wilson action, demonstrating the sensitivity of the spin-splitting to
the magnetic moment term which is present in the clover action. However, even
with the clover action the result is less than half of the physical
mass-splitting. We also compute the decay constants $f_{\eta_c}$ and
$f^{-1}_{J/\psi}$, both of which are considerably larger when computed using
the clover action than with the Wilson action. For example for the ratio
$f^{-1}_{J/\psi}/f^{-1}_{\rho}$ we find 0.32\err{1}{2} with the Wilson action
and $0.48\pm 3$ with the clover action (the physical value is 0.44(2)).

analysis indicate that the critical point occurs at $\beta =0.225(5)$ and that

coincident. The monopole condensation data satisfies finite size scaling
hypotheses with critical indices compatible with four dimensional percolation.
The best chiral equation of state fit produces critical exponents
($\delta=2.31$, $\beta_{mag}=0.763$) which deviate significantly from mean
field expectations. Data for the ratio of the sigma to pion masses produces an
estimate of the critical index $\delta$ in good agreement with chiral
condensate measurements. In the strong coupling phase the ratio of the meson
masses are $M_\sigma^2/M_\rho^2\approx 0.35$, $M_{A_1}^2/M_\rho^2\approx 1.4$

transition $M_\pi^2/M_\rho^2\approx 1.0$, $M_{A_1}^2/M_\rho^2\approx 1.0$,

scalar bound states. We calculate the $O(1/N_f)$ corrections to this picture,
where $N_f$ is the number of fermion species, for a variety of models and
confirm their renormalizability to this order. A connection between
renormalizability and the hyperscaling relations between the theory's critical
exponents is made explicit. We present results of extensive numerical
simulations of the simplest model for $d=3$, performed using the hybrid Monte
Carlo algorithm on lattice sizes ranging from $8^3$ to $24^3$. For $N_f=12$
species of massless fermions we confirm the existence of a second order phase
transition where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Using both direct
measurement and finite size scaling arguments we estimate the critical
exponents $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\nu$ and $\delta$. We also investigate symmetry
restoration at non-zero temperature, and the scalar two-point correlation
function in the vicinity of the bulk transition. All our results are in
excellent agreement with analytic predictions, and support the contention that
the $1/N_f$ expansion is accurate for this class of models.
