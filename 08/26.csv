half-filling case of \pi-electrons. (1) When the undimerized systems do not
have a gap, the Kekul\'{e} structures tend to occur. These structures are
commensurate with the boundary condition in the direction perpendicular to the
tubular axis. The energy gap is of the order of the room temperatures at most.
Thus, the nearly metallic properties would be expected. (2) If the undimerized
systems have a large gap (\sim 1eV), the most stable structures are the
chain-like distortions where the direction of the arranged {\sl
trans}-polyacetylene chains is along almost the tubular axis. When we try to
obtain the Kekul\'{e} structures, the mismatch of the boundary condition occurs
and they are energetically unfavorable. The electronic structures are of
semiconductors due to the large gap.

Karrai et al. for vortices in high Tc superconductors. We begin with a
substantial review and introduction. The microscopic response of vortices is
calculated from the Bogoliubov-deGennes equation, including an equation of
motion and conductivity. We find that the expected resonant dipole transtition
is not present because of translation invariance. We consider the effect of
pinning and show that in the presence of pinning one recovers the dipole
resonance. Thus we conclude that pinning may play an important role in the
experiment.

the two species of fermions to two species of hardcore bosons is performed in
detail, and the ``extra phases'' arising from odd-even effects are explicitly
derived. Bosons are shown to prefer zero flux (i.e. diamagnetism), and the
corresponding ``happy fluxes'' for the fermions identified. A curious result
following from the interplay between orbital diamagnetism and spin polarization
is highlighted.
  A ``spin-statistics'' like theorem, showing that the anticommutation
relations between fermions of opposite spin are crucial to obtain the SU(2)
invariance is pointed out.
