using anisotropic lattices are presented. In both the large $N$ approximation
and numerical simulations using the Wolff cluster algorithm we find that the
ratio of the symmetry restoration temperature $T_{\rm SR}$ to the Higgs mass
$m_{\rm H}$ is independent of the anisotropy $\xi$. From the numerical
simulations we obtain a lower bound of $T_{\rm SR} / m_{\rm H} \simeq 0.58 \pm
0.02$ at a value for the Higgs mass $m_{\rm H}a_s \simeq 0.5$, which is lowered
further by about $10\%$ at $m_{\rm H}a_s \simeq 1$. Requiring certain timelike
correlation functions to coincide with their spacelike counterparts, quantum
and scaling corrections to the anisotropy are determined and are found to be
small, i.e., the anisotropy is found to be close to the ratio of spacelike and
timelike lattice spacings.

$\lambda$ are the bare mass and self coupling of the scalar field in the model
respectively, we find a line of first order phase transitions in the ($m_0,
\lambda$) plane ending in a critical point where $\lambda$ is nonzero. Kazakov
and Migdal speculate that their model of scalar field theory could induce QCD.
Our work indicates that for $N=2$ there is no continuum limit for the
Kazakov-Migdal model except at the critical end point. Whether or not a
nontrivial continuum limit exists in the vicinity of the critical point
requires careful study of the renormalization group properties of the model.

M_{H_C} \leq 2 \times 10^{17}~\GeV$, taking both weak- and GUT-scale threshold

present experimental limits on the nucleon decay turn out to be consistent with
the SUSY particles lighter than 1~TeV even without a cancellation between
matrix elements contributed from different generations, if one adopts a
relatively large value of $M_{H_C}$ ($\ge2\times 10^{16}~\GeV$). We also show
that the Yukawa coupling constant of color-triplet Higgs multiplet does not
necessarily blow up below the gravitational scale ($2.4\times10^{18}~\GeV$)
even with the largest possible value of $M_{H_C}$. We point out that the
no-scale model is still viable, though it is strongly constrained.
