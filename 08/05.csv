Everett interpretation, and extensions of it, and their application to quantum
cosmology. We review the steps that are normally taken in the process of
extracting predictions from solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for
quantum cosmological models. Some difficulties and their possible resolution
are discussed. We conclude that the usual wave function-based approach admits
at best a rather heuristic interpretation, although it may in the future be
justified by appeal to the decoherent histories approach.

possible approaches to the quantization are demonstrated in this case. One is
to solve directly a system of operator equations, proposed by Tyutin and one of
the authors (Gitman) as a generalization of Dirac canonical quantization in
nonstationary case, and another to find first a canonical transformation, which
makes it possible to discribe the dynamics in the physical sactor by means of
some effective Hamiltonian. Quantum mechanics constructed in both cases proves
to be equivalent to Klein-Gordon theory of the relativistic particle in a plane

hamiltonian quantization of the $SL(2,R)$ 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory
with fractional coupling constant $k=s/r$ on a space manifold with torus
topology in the ``constrain-first'' framework. By generalizing the ``Weyl-odd''
projection to the fractional charge case, we obtain multi-components
holomorphic wave functions whose components are the Kac-Wakimoto characters of
the modular invariant admissible representations of ${\hat A}_1$ current
algebra with fractional level. The modular representations carried by the
quantum Hilbert space satisfy both Verlinde's and Vafa's constraints coming
from conformal field theory. They are the ``square-roots'' of the
representations associated to the conformal $(r,s)$ minimal models. Our results
imply that Chern-Simons theory with $SO(2,2)$ as gauge group, which describes
$2+1$-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant, has the modular
properties of the Virasoro discrete series. On the way, we show that the
2-dimensional counterparts of Chern-Simons $SU(2)$ theories with half-integer
charge $k=p/2$
