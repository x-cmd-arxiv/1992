Gravity involve weighted averaging over sets of all distinct triangulations of
compact four-dimensional manifolds. In order to be able to perform such
computations one needs an algorithm which for any given $N$ and a given compact
four-dimensional manifold $M$ constructs all possible triangulations of $M$
with $\leq N$ simplices. Our first result is that such algorithm does not
exist. Then we discuss recursion-theoretic limitations of any algorithm
designed to perform approximate calculations of sums over all possible
triangulations of a compact four-dimensional manifold.

three active and one inert neutrino paying special attention to the possible
(almost) conserved generalization of the Zeldovich-Konopinski-Mahmoud lepton
charge. Using Planck scale physics effects which provide the breaking of the
lepton charge, we show how in this picture one can incorporate the solutions to
some of the central issues in neutrino physics such as the solar and
atmospheric neutrino puzzles, dark matter and a 17 keV neutrino. These
gravitational effects induce tiny Majorana mass terms for neutrinos and
considerable masses for flavons. The cosmological demand for the sufficiently
fast decay of flavons implies a lower limit on the electron neutrino mass in
the range of 0.1-1 eV.

certain linear covariant gauge, possesses a vector supersymmetry. The generator
of the latter together with those of the BRS transformations and of the
translations form the basis of a superalgebra of the Wess-Zumino type. We give
a general classification of all possible anomalies and invariant counterterms.
Their absence, which amounts to ultraviolet finiteness, follows from purely
algebraic arguments in the lower-dimensional cases.
