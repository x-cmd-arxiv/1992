theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, integrable hierarchies of KdV
type, matrix models, and topological quantum field theories. We explain in
particular why matrix integrals of the type considered by Kontsevich naturally
appear as tau-functions associated to minimal models. Our starting point is the
extremely simple form of the string equation for the topological (p,1) models,
where the so-called Baker-Akhiezer function is given by a (generalized) Airy
function.

super-worldsheet, rather than on an ordinary worldsheet, many problems with the
interacting Green-Schwarz superstring formalism can be solved. In the
light-cone approach, superconformally transforming the light-cone
super-worldsheet onto an N=(2,0) super-Riemann surface allows the elimination
of the non-trivial interaction-point operators that complicate the evaluation
of scattering amplitudes. In the Polyakov approach, the ten-dimensional
heterotic Green-Schwarz covariant action defined on an N=(2,0) super-worldsheet
can be gauge-fixed to a free-field action with non-anomalous N=(2,0)
superconformal invariance, and integrating the exponential of the covariant
action over all punctured N=(2,0) super-Riemann surfaces produces scattering
amplitudes that closely resemble amplitudes obtained using the unitary
light-cone approach.
