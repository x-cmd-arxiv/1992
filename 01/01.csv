is based on the concept of real analytic curves in locally convex vector

conditions the second requirement can be replaced by: real analytic along
affine lines. Enclosed and necessary is a careful study of locally convex
topologies on spaces of real analytic mappings. As an application we also
present the theory of manifolds of real analytic mappings: the group of real
analytic diffeomorphisms of a compact real analytic manifold is a real analytic
Lie group.

considerations with the very sophisticated geometric and algebraic structures.
In fact, part of the drama of the subject is guessing what type of techniques
will be appropriate for a given investigation: Will it be direct and simple
notions related to schematic drawings of trees or will it be notions from the
deepest parts of algebraic group theory, ergodic theory, or commutative algebra
which must be brought to bear? Part of the beauty of the subject is that the
na\""{\i}ve tree considerations have an impact on these more sophisticated
topics and that in addition, trees form a bridge between these disparate
subjects.

complexity theory called information-based complexity theory (IBCT), which
produces an abundance of impressive results about the quest for approximate
solutions to mathematical problems. Why then do most numerical analysts turn a
cold shoulder to IBCT? Close analysis of two representative papers reveals a
mixture of nice new observations, error bounds repackaged in new language,
misdirected examples, and misleading theorems.
  Some elements in the framework of IBCT, erected to support a rigorous yet
flexible theory, make it difficult to judge whether a model is off-target or
reasonably realistic. For instance, a sharp distinction is made between
information and algorithms restricted to this information. Yet the information
itself usually comes from an algorithm, so the distinction clouds the issues
and can lead to true but misleading inferences. Another troublesome aspect of
IBCT is a free parameter $F$, the class of admissible problem instances. By
overlooking $F$'s membership fee, the theory sometimes distorts the economics
of problem solving in a way reminiscent of agricultural subsidies.
  The current theory's surprising results pertain only to unnatural situations,
and its genuinely new insights might serve us better if expressed in the
conventional modes of error analysis and approximation theory.
