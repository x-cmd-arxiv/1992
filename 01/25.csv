understood as gauge transformations in string field theory. We establish this
fact by working out some examples. As a by product, we could identify some of
the fields appearing in string field theory with their counterparts in the
$\sigma$-model.

review some old statements on field theoretic hair on blackholes. We also
discuss some stability issues. In particular we argue that the two dimensional
string blackhole solution is semi-classically stable while the naked
singularity is unstable to tachyon fluctuations. Finally we comment on the
relation between the linear dilaton theory and the $2d$ blackhole solution.
