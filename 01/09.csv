between large and small radii: compactification on a circle, for example, is
invariant under R goes to 1/R. Compactification on more general Lorentzian
lattices (i.e. toroidal compactification in the presence of background metric,
antisymmetric tensor, and gauge fields) yields theories for which large-small
invariance is not so simple. Here an equivalence is demonstrated between large
and small geometries for all toroidal compactifications. By repeatedly
transforming the momentum mode corresponding to the smallest winding length to
another mode on the lattice, it is possible to increase the volume to exceed a
finite lower bound.

functions of the main operators in continuous and lattice models of 1d spinless
Bose-gas with pairwise interaction of rather general form are obtained. The
long-wave properties of these systems can be described by the Gaussian model
with central charge $c=1$. The disorder operators of the extended Gaussian
model are found to correspond to some non-local operators in the {\it XXZ}
Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Just the same approach is applicable to fermionic
systems. Scaling dimensions of operators and correlation functions in the
systems of interacting Fermi-particles are obtained. We present a universal
treatment for $1d$ systems of different kinds which is independent of the exact
integrability and gives universal expressions for critical exponents through
the thermodynamic characteristics of the system.

KP-hierarchy, subjected to a kind of ${\cal L}_{-1}$-constraint. Moreover,
partition function behaves smoothly in the limit of infinitely large matrices.
If the potential is equal to $X^{K+1}$, this partition function becomes a
$\tau$-function of $K$-reduced KP-hierarchy, obeying a set of ${\cal W}
_K$-algebra constraints identical to those conjectured in \cite{FKN91} for
double-scaling continuum limit of $(K-1)$-matrix model. In the case of $K=2$
the statement reduces to the early established \cite{MMM91b} relation between
Kontsevich model and the ordinary $2d$ quantum gravity . Kontsevich model with
generic potential may be considered as interpolation between all the models of
$2d$ quantum gravity with $c<1$ preserving the property of integrability and
the analogue of string equation.
