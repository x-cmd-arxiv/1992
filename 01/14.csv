of a centerless Virasoro algebra and an abelian spin-1 current. This algebra
conventionally emerges in the study of pseudo-differential operators on a
circle or alternatively within KP hierarchy with Watanabe's bracket.
Construction used here is based on a special deformation of the algebra
$w_{\infty}$ of area preserving diffeomorphisms of a 2-manifold. We show that
this deformation technique applies to the two-loop WZNW and conformal affine
Toda models, establishing henceforth $W_{\infty}$ invariance of these models.

the Noether current $j_\mu$ associated with the global symmetry of the theory,
a composite scalar field $j$, the algebra closes under Poisson brackets.

entitled ""W-Geometries"" to be published in Phys. Lett. It is shown that the
$A_n$--W-geometry corresponds to chiral surfaces in $CP^n$. This is comes out
by discussing 1) the extrinsic geometries of chiral surfaces (Frenet-Serret and
Gauss-Codazzi equations) 2) the KP coordinates (W-parametrizations) of the
target-manifold, and their fermionic (tau-function) description, 3) the
intrinsic geometries of the associated chiral surfaces in the Grassmannians,
and the associated higher instanton- numbers of W-surfaces. For regular points,
the Frenet-Serret equations for $CP^n$--W-surfaces are shown to give the
geometrical meaning of the $A_n$-Toda Lax pair, and of the conformally-reduced
WZNW models, and Drinfeld-Sokolov equations. KP coordinates are used to show
that W-transformations may be extended as particular diffeomorphisms of the
target-space. This leads to higher-dimensional generalizations of the WZNW and
DS equations. These are related with the Zakharov- Shabat equations. For
singular points, global Pl\""ucker formulae are derived by combining the
$A_n$-Toda equations with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem written for each of the
associated surfaces.

coprime integers, and ${SU(2)_m\times SU(2)_1\over SU(2)_{m+1}}$. In the latter
case it is shown that the Chern-Simons wave functionals can be identified with
t he characters of the minimal unitary models, and an explicit representation
of the knot (Verlinde) operators acting on the space of $c<1$ characters is
obtained.
