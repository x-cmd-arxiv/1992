are a mixture of first and second class constraints and are degenerate. We show
that they admit a first-class subsystem from which they can be recovered by
gauge-fixing, and that the non-degenerate constraints can be handled by
previous methods. The degenerate constraints present a new situation in which
the natural primary field basis for the gauge-invariants is rational rather
than polynomial. We give an algorithm for constructing the rational basis and
converting the base elements to polynomials.

conformally invariant in the supersymmetric case. We also demonstrate that this
metric, together with a recently proposed exact metric for the bosonic case,
are respectively consistent with the supersymmetric and bosonic $\sigma$-model
conformal invariance conditions up to four-loop order.
