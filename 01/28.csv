more discrete states and associated symmetries in $D=2$ string theory than has
been recognized hitherto. The full structure, at the $SU(2)$ radius, has a
natural description in terms of abelian gauge theory on a certain three
dimensional cone $Q$. We describe precisely how symmetry currents are
constructed from the discrete states, explaining the role of the ``descent
equations.'' In the uncompactified theory, we compute the action of the
symmetries on the tachyon field, and isolate the features that lead to
nonlinear terms in this action. The resulting symmetry structure is interpreted
in terms of a homotopy Lie algebra.

"hep-th/9201057",,"C. M. Hull","Classical and Quantum W-Gravity","54 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  Classical W-gravities and the corresponding quantum theories are reviewed.
W-gravities are higher-spin gauge theories in two dimensions whose gauge
algebras are W-algebras. The geometrical structure of classical W-gravity is
investigated, leading to surprising connections with self-dual geometry. The
anomalies that arise in quantum W-gravity are discussed, with particular
attention to the new types of anomalies that arise for non-linearly realised
symmetries and to the relation between path-integral anomalies and non-closure
of the quantum current algebra. Models in which all anomalies are cancelled by
ghost contributions lead to new generalisations of string theories.
