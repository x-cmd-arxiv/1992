massless gauge fields, contrary to the spirit of the ``no-hair'' theorems. We
describe in detail two different types of black hole hair that decay
exponentially at long range. The first type is associated with discrete gauge
charge and the screening is due to the Higgs mechanism. The second type is
associated with color magnetic charge, and the screening is due to color
confinement. In both cases, we perform semi-classical calculations of the
effect of the hair on local observables outside the horizon, and on black hole
thermodynamics. These effects are generated by virtual cosmic strings, or
virtual electric flux tubes, that sweep around the event horizon. The effects
of discrete gauge charge are non-perturbative in $\hbar$, but the effects of
color magnetic charge become $\hbar$-independent in a suitable limit. We
present an alternative treatment of discrete gauge charge using dual variables,
and examine the possibility of black hole hair associated with discrete {\it
global} symmetry. We draw the distinction between {\it primary} hair, which
endows a black hole with new quantum numbers, and {\it secondary} hair, which
does not, and we point out some varieties of secondary hair that occur in the
standard model of particle physics.

point out some peculiarities. The constraints and the possible presence of the
cosmological constants are systematically exhibited in the zero-curvature
condition, which also yields the relevant Ward identities. The restrictions on
the gauge parameters in presence of the constraints are also pointed out and
are contrasted with those of the ordinary 2d-gravity.

it necessary to make a gauge choice, as the chiral group elements are not gauge
invariant observables. (On the other hand, the quadratic form of the Poisson
brackets may be defined independent of a gauge fixing.) Gauge invariant
observables can be formed from the monodromy matrix and these observables are
seen to commute in the quantum theory.
