and studied. These coset models are formulated as Complex BRST cohomology in
$G^c_k$, the complexified level $k$ current algebra. The finite physical
spectrum corresponds to the conformal blocks of $G_k$ .The amplitudes for $G/G$
theories are argued to be given in terms of the $G_k$ fusion rules. The
$G_k/G_k$ character is the Kac-Weyl numerator of $G_k$ and is interpreted as an
index. The Complex BRST cohomology is found to contain states of arbitrary
ghost number. Intriguing similarities of $G/G$ to $c\leq 1$ matter systems
coupled to two dimensional gravity are pointed out.

gravity $(k = 2)$ to all non unitary minimal multicritical points $(k \geq 3)$.
The resulting interacting Fermi gas theory is treated in the collective field
framework. Making use of the fact that the matrices evolve in Langevin time,
the Jacobian from matrix coordinates to collective modes is similar to the
corresponding Jacobian in $d = 1$ matrix models. The collective field theory is
analyzed in the planar limit. The saddle point eigenvalue distribution is the
one that defines the original multicritical point and therefore exhibits the
appropriate scaling behaviour. Some comments on the nonperturbative properties
of the collective field theory as well as comments on the Virasoro constraints
associated with the loop equations are made at the end of this letter. There we
also make some remarks on the fermionic formulation of the model and its
integrability, as a nonlocal version of the non linear Schr\""{o}dinger model.
