following the recent work of Distler and Nelson on the bosonic and semirigid
strings. In the bosonic case dilaton two-point functions on the sphere are
calculated as a stepping stone to constructing a `good' coordinate family for
dilaton calculations on higher genus surfaces. It is found that dilaton-dilaton
contact terms are improperly normalized, suggesting that the interpretation of
the dilaton as the first variation of string coupling breaks down when other
dilatons are present. It seems likely that this can be attributed to the
tachyon divergence found in \TCCT. For the heterotic case, it is found that
there is no tachyon divergence and that the dilaton contact terms are properly
normalized. Thus, a dilaton equation analogous to the one in topological
gravity is derived and the interpretation of the dilaton as the string coupling
constant goes through.

coupled to $C \leq 1$ matter, and to the chiral algebra ($w_{\infty}$) of
$C_{M} = 1$ theory which has been found recently, in the continuum approach, by
Witten and by Klebanov and Polyakov. It is shown then that the chiral algebra
is being realized as well in the minimal models of gravity ($C_{M}<1$), so that
it stands as a general symmetry of 2D gravity theories.

characters (or level-K string functions) for the cases K=4, K=8, and K=16.
These identities fall into three classes: identities in the first class are
generalizations of the famous Jacobi theta-function identity (which is the K=2
special case), identities in another class relate the level K>2 characters to
the Dedekind eta-function, and identities in a third class relate the K>2
characters to the Jacobi theta-functions. These identities play a crucial role
in the interpretation of fractional superstring spectra by indicating spacetime
supersymmetry and aiding in the identification of the spacetime spin and
statistics of fractional superstring states.
