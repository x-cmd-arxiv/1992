This explains the origin of the ``twistor-like'' variables that have been used
in trading the superparticle's $\kappa$-symmetry for worldline supersymmetry.
We show that these twistor-like variables naturally parametrise the coset space
${\cal G}/{\cal H}$, where $\cal G$ is the Lorentz group $SO^\uparrow(1,d-1)$
and $\cal H$ is its maximal subgroup. This space is a compact manifold, the
sphere $S^{d-2}$. Our group-theoretical construction gives the proper
covariantisation of a fixed light-cone frame and clarifies the relation between
target-space and worldline supersymmetries.

involving metric and a scalar field. Different models are parametrized in terms
of a scalar potential. We show that a general Liouville-type model with
exponential potential and linear curvature coupling is renormalisable at the
quantum level while a particular model (corresponding to D=2 graviton-dilaton
string effective action and having a black hole solution) is finite. We use the
condition of a ``split"" Weyl symmetry to suggest possible expressions for the
``effective"" action which includes the quantum anomaly term.
