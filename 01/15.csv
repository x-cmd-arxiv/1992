rise to a vanishing cosmological constant to one-loop, cannot be realized by a
consistent lattice string. The construction of non-supersymmetric string with a
vanishing cosmological constant therefore remains as elusive as ever. We also
discuss a new test that any one-loop partition function for a lattice string
must satisfy.

quantum corrections in background metrics admitting super-covariantly constant
spinors. In particular, these metrics include the Robinson-Bertotti metric
(product of two 2-dimensional spaces of constant curvature) with all 8
supersymmetries unbroken. Another example is a set of arbitrary number of
extreme Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes. These black holes break 4 of 8
supersymmetries, leaving the other 4 unbroken.
  We have found manifestly supersymmetric black holes, which are non-trivial
solutions of the flatness condition $\cd^{2} = 0$ of the corresponding
(shortened) superspace. Their bosonic part describes a set of extreme
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes. The super black hole solutions are exact even
when all quantum supergravity corrections are taken into account.

``a Boolean algebra with no endomorphisms except the ones induced by
ultrafilters on it'' (see section 2 here) and proved the existence of one with
character density aleph_0, assuming first diamondsuit_{aleph_1} and then only
CH. The idea was that if h is an endomorphism of B, not among the ``trivial''
ones, then there are pairwise disjoint D_n in B with h(d_n) not subset d_n.
Then we can, for some S subset omega, add an element x such that d <= x for n
in S, x cap d_n=0 for n not in S while forbidding a solution for {y cap
h(d_n):n in S} cup {y cap h(d_n)=0:n not in S}. Further analysis showed that
the point is that we are omitting positive quantifier free types. Continuing
this Monk succeeded to prove in ZFC, the existence of such Boolean algebras of
cardinality 2^{aleph_0}.
  We prove (in ZFC) the existence of such B of density character lambda and
cardinality lambda^{aleph_0} whenever lambda > aleph_0. We can conclude answers
to some questions from Monk's list. We use a combinatorial method from
[Sh:45],[Sh:172], that is represented in Section 1.

cardinals lambda with kappa <= lambda < kappa^{+ omega}, 2^lambda = lambda^+,
we present a ``mini-coding'' between kappa and kappa^{+ omega}. This allows us
to prove that any subset of kappa^{+ omega} can be coded into a subset, W of
kappa^+ which, further, ``reshapes'' the interval [kappa, kappa^+), i.e., for
all kappa < delta < kappa^+, kappa = (card delta)^{L[W cap delta]}. We sketch
two applications of this result, assuming 0^sharp does not exist. First, we
point out that this shows that any set can be coded by a real, via a set
forcing. The second application involves a notion of abstract condensation, due
to Woodin. Our methods can be used to show that for any cardinal mu,
condensation for mu holds in a generic extension by a set forcing.
