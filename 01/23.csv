heterotic fivebrane source are classified. The orbits are found to be either
circular or open, but not conic because the inverse square law is not satisfied
at long range. This result differs from predictions of General Relativity. The
conserved total angular momentum contains an intrinsic component from the
fivebrane source, analogous to the electron-monopole case.

heterotic fivebrane sources is fully analyzed, for arbitrary instanton scale
size. The singular case is treated as a special case and does not arise in the
continuous limit of zero instanton size. We find that the orbits are either
circular or open, which is a solitonic analogy with the motion of an electron
around a magnetic monopole, although the system we consider is quantitatively
different. We emphasize that at long distance this geometry does not satisfy
the inverse square law, but satisfies the inverse cubic law. If the fivebrane
exists in nature and this structure survives after any proper compactification,
this last result can be used to test classical ``stringy'' effects.
