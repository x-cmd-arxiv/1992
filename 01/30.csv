arbitrary central charge $c^M = c(p,q) < 1$ in the conformal gauge. We apply a
Lian-Zuckerman $SO(2,\bbc)$ ($(p,q)$ - dependent) rotation to Witten's $c^M =
1$ chiral ground ring. We show that the ring structure generated by the
(relative BRST cohomology) discrete states in the (matter $\otimes$ Liouville
$\otimes$ ghosts) Fock module may be obtained by this rotation. We give also
explicit formulae for the discrete states. For some of them we use new formulae
for $c <1$ Fock modules singular vectors which we present in terms of Schur
polynomials generalizing the $c=1$ expressions of Goldstone, while the rest of
the discrete states we obtain by finding the proper $SO(2,\bbc)$ rotation. Our
formulae give the extra physical states (arising from the relative BRST
cohomology) on the boundaries of the $p \times q$ rectangles of the conformal
lattice and thus all such states in $(1,q)$ or $(p,1)$ models.

string theory corresponding to the c=1 matrix model. These are shown to deform
the action of the ground ring on the tachyon modules, confirming a conjecture
of Witten. The ground ring structure is used to derive recursion relations
which relate (N+1) and N tachyon bulk scattering amplitudes. These recursion
relations allow one to compute all bulk amplitudes.

wave functions which satisfy the Wheeler-deWitt equation and momentum
constraints, together with certain `wormhole boundary conditions'. We consider
a massless minimally coupled scalar field, initially in the spherically
symmetric `mini-superspace' approximation, and then in the `midi-superspace'
approximation, where non-spherically symmetric perturbations are linearized
about a spherically symmetric mini-superspace background. Our approach suggests
that there are higher derivative corrections to the vertex operator from the
non-spherically symmetric perturbations. This is compared directly with the
approach based on complete wormhole solutions to the equations of motion where
it has been claimed that the semi-classical vertex operator is exactly given by
the lowest order term, to all orders in the size of the wormhole throat. Our
results are also compared with the conformally coupled case.

always leads to a curvature singularity, according to these equations, and that
the region where the quantum corrections introduced by Callan {\it et al.}
could be expected to dominate is on the unphysical side of the singularity. The
model can be successfully applied to study the back-reaction of Hawking
radiation on the geometry of large mass black holes, but the description breaks
down before the evaporation is complete.
