duality as a symmetry of string field theory and to study explicitly issues in
background independence. Our starting point is the notion that the string field
coordinates $X(\sigma)$ and the momenta $P(\sigma)$ are background independent
objects whose field algebra is always the same; backgrounds correspond to
inequivalent representations of this algebra. We propose classical string field
solutions relating any two toroidal backgrounds and discuss the space where
these solutions are defined.
  String field theories formulated around dual backgrounds are shown to be
related by a homogeneous field redefinition, and are therefore equivalent, if
and only if their string field coupling constants are identical. Using this
discrete equivalence of backgrounds and the classical solutions we find
discrete symmetry transformations of the string field leaving the string action
invariant. These symmetries, which are spontaneously broken for generic
backgrounds, are shown to generate the full group of duality symmetries, and in
general are seen to arise from the string field gauge group.

perturbation, and string field theories constructed around such backgrounds, we
show how to construct explicit redefinition of string fields which relate these
two string field theories. The analysis is carried out completely for quadratic
and cubic terms in the action. Although a general proof of existence of field
redefinitions which relate higher point vertices is not given, specific
examples are discussed. Equivalence of string field theories formulated around
two conformal field theories which are not close to each other, but are related
to each other by a series of marginal deformations, is also discussed. The
analysis can also be applied to study the equivalence of different formulation
of string field theories around the same background.

the Coleman peak at zero cosmological constant, for a fixed De Witt

give a positive semi-definite Hessian contribution to the 5-D partition
function, thus removing the Polchinski phase ambiguity.

in the ``little wormhole'' limit is real. Extension of the CM solutions with
the inclusion of a bare cosmological constant to the case of a sphere $S^4$ can
lead to the elimination of the destabilizing effects of the scalar modes of
gravity against those of the matter. In particular, in the asymptotic region of
a large 4-sphere, we recover the Coleman's $\exp \left (\exp \left ({1\over
\lambda_{eff}}\right )\right )$ peak at the effective cosmological constant
$\lambda_{eff}=0$, with no phase ambiguities in $Z_{EQG}$.
