quantum Chern-Simons dynamics was developed. It makes use of neither gauge
conditions nor functional integrals and needs only ideas known from QCD and
quantum gravity. It gives Witten's conformal edge states in a simple way when
the spatial slice is a disc. Here we extend the formalism by including sources
as well. The quantum states of a source with a fixed spatial location are shown
to be those of a conformal family, a result also discovered first by Witten.
The internal states of a source are not thus associated with just a single ray
of a Hilbert space. Vertex operators for both abelian and nonabelian sources
are constructed. The regularized abelian Wilson line is proved to be a vertex
operator. We also argue in favor of a similar nonabelian result. The
spin-statistics theorem is established for Chern-Simons dynamics even though
the sources are not described by relativistic quantum fields. The proof employs
geometrical methods which we find are strikingly transparent and pleasing. It
is based on the research of European physicists about ``fields localized on
cones.''

strings in 1+1 spacetime dimensions reveals unexpected structures. One is the
existence of a gauge choice that gives a free action at the price of
propagating ghosts and a nontrivial BRST charge. Fixing this gauge leaves a
U(1) Kac-Moody algebra of residual symmetry, generated by a conformal tensor of
rank two and a conformal scalar. Another is that the BRST charge made from
these currents is nilpotent when the action includes a linear dilaton
background, independent of the particular value of the dilaton gradient.
Spacetime Lorentz invariance in this theory is still elusive, however, because
of the linear dilaton background and the nature of the gauge symmetries.

$N$. The $W_N$ constraints freeze $N-2$ coordinates, while the remaining
coordinates appear in the currents only {\it via} their energy-momentum tensor.
The spectrum is then effectively described by a set of ordinary Virasoro-like
string theories, but with a non-critical value for the central charge and a
discrete set of non-standard values for the spin-2 intercepts. In particular,
the physical spectrum of the $W_N$ string includes the usual massless states of
the Virasoro string. By looking at the norms of low-lying states, we find
strong indications that all the $W_N$ strings are unitary.

symmetric spaces, which constitute the most general class of classical
non-linear sigma models known to be integrable, is shown to be governed by a
fundamental Poisson bracket relation that fits into the $r$-$s$-matrix
formalism for non-ultralocal integrable models first discussed by Maillet. The
matrices $r$ and $s$ are computed explicitly and, being field dependent,
satisfy fundamental Poisson bracket relations of their own, which can be
expressed in terms of a new numerical matrix~$c$. It is proposed that all these
Poisson brackets taken together are representation conditions for a new kind of
algebra which, for this class of models, replaces the classical Yang-Baxter
algebra governing the canonical structure of ultralocal models. The Poisson
brackets for the transition matrices are also computed, and the notorious
regularization problem associated with the definition of the Poisson brackets
for the monodromy matrices is discussed.
