those with modular-invariant superpotentials arising in superstring
compactifications. Such domain walls are shown to saturate the Bogomol'nyi
bound of wall energy per unit area. We find \sl static \rm and \sl reflection
asymmetric \rm domain wall solutions of the self-duality equations for the
metric and the matter fields. Our result establishes a new class of domain
walls beyond those previously classified. As a corollary, we define a precise
notion of vacuum degeneracy in the supergravity theories. In addition, we found
examples of global supersymmetric domain walls that do not have an analog when
gravity is turned on. This result establishes that in the case of extended
topological defects gravity plays a crucial, nontrivial role.

"math/9201202",,"Tadek Figiel, William B. Johnson, and Gideon Schechtman","Factorizations of natural embeddings of l_p^n int L_r",,,,"Banach Archive 8/4/89","math.FA",,"  This is a continuation of the paper [FJS] with a similar title. Several
results from there are strengthened, in particular:
  1. If T is a ""natural"" embedding of l_2^n into L_1 then, for any well-bounded
factorization of T through an L_1 space in the form T=uv with v of norm one, u
well-preserves a copy of l_1^k with k exponential in n.
  2. Any norm one operator from a C(K) space which well-preserves a copy of
l_2^n also well-preserves a copy of l_{\infty}^k with k exponential in n.
  As an application of these and other results we show the existence, for any
n, of an n-dimensional space which well-embeds into a space with an
unconditional basis only if the latter contains a copy of l_{\infty}^k with k
exponential in n.
