with quadratic non-linearity is given. General formulas describing their
structure are found by solving the Jacobi identities. A complete classification
of quasisuperconformal and ${\bf Z}_2\times{\bf Z}_2$-graded algebras are
obtained and in addition to the previously known cases five exceotional
quasisuperconformal algebras and a series of ${\bf Z}_2\times{\bf
Z}_2$-superconformal algebras containing affine
$\widehat{sp}_2\otimes\widehat{osp}(N|2M)$ are constructed.

constructed {}from their successive equations of motion is briefly reviewed. On
the one hand, a certain triality structure is described, relating arbitrary
field theories, {\it classical\ts} topological field theories -- whose
classical solutions span topological classes of manifolds -- and
reparametrisation invariant theories -- generalising ordinary string and
membrane theories. On the other hand, {\it finite} Euler hierarchies are
constructed for all three classes of theories. These hierarchies terminate with
{\it universal\ts} equations of motion, probably defining new integrable
systems as they admit an infinity of Lagrangians. Speculations as to the
possible relevance of these theories to quantum gravity are also suggested.

compensating fields. In particular, we discuss the relation between the
components formulation and the superspace formulation of supergravity theories.
The requirement that the compensating field can be eliminated at the quantum
level gives rise to on-shell constraints on the operators of the theory. In
some cases, the constraints turn out to be physically unacceptable. Using these
considerations we show that new minimal supergravity is in general anomalous.
