the threshold for sliding is approached. Using the Fukuyama-Lee-Rice
Hamiltonian with relaxational dynamics, the polarization and linear response
are calculated numerically. ... On the irreversible approach to threshold, the
response due to avalanches triggered by local instabilities dominates the
polarizability, which diverges in one and two dimensions. Characteristic
diverging length scales are studied using finite-size scaling of the
sample-to-sample variations of the threshold field in finite systems and
finite-size effects in the linear polarizability and the irreversible
polarization. A dominant diverging correlation length is found which controls
the threshold field distribution, finite-size effects in the irreversible
polarization, and a cutoff size for the avalanche size distribution. Our
results are compared with those for related models and questions are raised
concerning the relationship of the static critical behavior below threshold to
the dynamic critical behavior in the sliding state above threshold.

"hep-lat/9207029","P. van Baal","Pierre van Baal","Topology of the Yang-Mills Configuration space","4 pages. Invited talk at ISATQP, June 11-16, Shanxi University, China",,,,"hep-lat hep-th",,"  It will be described how to uniquely fix the gauge using Coulomb gauge
fixing, avoiding the problem of Gribov copies. The fundamental modular domain,
which represents a one-to-one representation of the set of gauge invariant
degrees of freedom, is a bounded convex subset of the trans- verse gauge
fields. Boundary identifications are the only remnants of the Gribov copies,
and carry all the information about the topology of the Yang-Mills
configuration space. Conversely, the known topology can be shown to imply that
(on a set of measure zero on the boundary) some points of the boundary coincide
with the Gribov horizon. For the low-lying energies, wavefunctionals can be
shown to spread out ""across"" certain parts of these boundaries. This is how the
topology of Yang-Mills configuration space has an essential influence on the
low-lying spectrum, in a situation where these non- perturbative effects are
not exponentially suppressed.
  This write-up is a short summary, with adequate references, where details on
most of the material I have presented can be found. However, not published
before, is a new observation concerning Henyey's gauge copies.

form, the color confinement mechanism proposed by Kugo and Ojima (KO) explains
the confinement of any colored particles including dynamical quarks and gluons.
This mechanism, however, is known to break down in the Abelian gauge which
treats the maximal Abelian subgroup of the gauge group in a special manner. In
order to study whether the failure of the KO mechanism is particular only to
the Abelian gauge or whether this failure occurs in a wide class of gauges
including the ordinary Lorentz type gauge, we carry out a renormalization group
study of the $SU(2)$ gauge theory in the gauge fixing space. Our gauge fixing
space consists of four distinct regions that are not connected with each other
by renormalization group flows, and we find that the Abelian gauge is {\it
infrared unstable} in three regions which include the Lorentz type gauge. This
suggests that the failure of the KO mechanism is a phenomenon which occurs only
in the Abelian gauge. We also find that the Lorentz gauge is infrared stable.

Faulhaber may well have discovered such results, and solves a 360-year-old
riddle that Faulhaber presented to his readers. It also shows that similar
results hold when we express the sums in terms of central factorial powers
instead of ordinary powers. Faulhaber's coefficients can moreover be
generalized to factorial powers of noninteger exponents, obtaining asymptotic
