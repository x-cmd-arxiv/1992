of extended objects on a linear substrate, accompanied by diffusional
relaxation. This new approximation plays the role of the mean-field theory for
such processes and is valid over a significantly larger range than an earlier
variant, which was based on a mapping to chemical reactions. In particular,
continuum-limit off-lattice deposition is described naturally within our
approximation. The criteria for the applicability of the mean-field theory are
derived. While deposition of dimers, and marginally, trimers, is affected by
fluctuations, we find that the k-mer deposition kinetics is asymptotically
mean-field like for all k=4,5,..., where the limit k->infinity, when properly
defined, describes deposition-diffusion kinetics in the continuum.

link chain $C$ is the weighted sum over Wilson loops made by joining to $C$ all
selfavoiding chains $\widetilde{C}$ closing $C$. (II)Weights
$A_{\widetilde{C}}$, containing all the $\lambda$-dependence, are given by the
$\beta=0$ $\lambda$-gauge expectation value of $\widetilde{C}$.
(III)$A_{\widetilde{C}}$ equals path-products of coefficients from the trace
expansion of the gaugefixing Boltzmann weight. From (II) and (III) we deduce
formulas for $\beta =0$ quark matrix elements. We find that $M_q^{(\lambda)}$
decreases with increasing $\lambda$; the quark propagator dispersion relation
is not covariant when $\lambda\ne 1$; and $\Delta I=1/2$ matching coefficients
are $\lambda$-independent. These strong coupling features are qualitatively
consistent with numerical $\beta=5.7$ and $6.0$ results briefly described here
for comparison purposes but mainly presented in a companion paper.

zero modes. Demanding that these gravitational effects not affet the axion
solution to the strong CP problem, we find that at least two sets of quarks

obviate the cosmological axion domain wall problem but leave unchanged problems
associated with coherent axion oscillations.
