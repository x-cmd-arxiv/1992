gauge invariance no extra counter terms are required. The Schr\""odinger
functional is, moreover, accessible to numerical simulations. It may hence be
used to study the scaling properties of the theory and in particular the
evolution of the renormalized gauge coupling from low to high energies. A
concrete proposition along this line is made and the necessary perturbative
analysis of the Schr\""odinger functional is carried through to 1-loop order.

that the massive phases have oscillatory correlation functions. We calculate
the wave vector scaling exponent. In the high-temperature massive phase the
pattern of the low-lying levels can be explained assuming the existence of two
particles, with $Z_3$-charge $Q\!=\!1$ and $Q\!=\!2$, and their scattering
states. In the superintegrable case the $Q\!=\!2$-particle has twice the mass

single particle gaps, while power convergence is seen for the scattering

a macroscopic momentum $P_m = \pm \vph/3$, where $\vph$ is the chiral angle.

unitarity of the representations of G we find an infinite set of chiral primary
states associated with the holomorphic discrete series representations of G.
Further requirement of the unitarity of the corresponding N=2 module truncates
this infinite set to a finite subset. The chiral primary states of the N=2
superconformal algebras realized over Freudenthal triple systems are also
studied. These algebras have the special property that they admit an extension
to N=4 superconformal algebras with the gauge group SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1). We
generalize the concept of the chiral rings to N=4 superconformal algebras. We
