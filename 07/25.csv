theory (NGT) is untenable due to curvature coupled ghost modes and bad
asymptotic behavior. This claim is false for it is based on a physically
inaccurate treatment of wave propagation on a curved background and an
incorrect method for extracting asymptotic behavior. We show that the flux of
gravitational radiation in NGT is finite in magnitude and positive in sign.

light fermions, using a method previously developed that includes the effects
of the fermionic interactions in an effective action. The approximations
involved are related to an expansion in the flavour number. We address the
problem of the (non) triviality of the theory through a study of the analytical
properties of the effective action as a function of the pure gauge energy. New
numerical results for the plaquette energy, chiral condensate and a qualitative
analysis of the phase diagram are also presented.

to study the $k^+ = 0$ region of light-cone perturbation theory. The light-cone
vacuum is shown to be unstable at the non-perturbative $\beta^2 = 8\pi$
critical point by a light-cone version of Coleman's variational method. Vacuum
bubbles, which are $k^+=0$ diagrams in light-cone field theory and are
individually finite and non-vanishing for all $\beta$, conspire to generate
ultraviolet divergences of the light-cone energy density. The $k^+ = 0$ region
of momentum also contributes to connected Green's functions; the connected two
point function will not diverge, as it should, at the critical point unless
diagrams which contribute only at $k^+ = 0$ are properly included. This
analysis shows in a simple way how the $k^+ =0$ region cannot be ignored even
for connected diagrams. This phenomenon is expected to occur in higher
dimensional gauge theories starting at two loop order in light-cone
perturbation theory.

scheme. The weak perturbation theory of transverse lattice non-compact QED is
developed in light-cone gauge, and we argue that for fixed lattice spacing this
theory is ultraviolet finite, order by order in perturbation theory. However,
by calculating the anomalous scaling dimension of the link fields, we find that
the interaction Hamiltonian becomes non-renormalizable for $g^2(a) > 4\pi$,
where $g(a)$ is the bare (lattice) QED coupling constant. We conjecture that
this is the critical point of the chiral symmetry breaking phase transition in
QED. Non-perturbative chiral symmetry breaking is then studied in the strong
coupling limit. The discrete remnant of chiral symmetry that remains on the
lattice is spontaneously broken, and the ground state to lowest order in the
strong coupling expansion corresponds to the classical ground state of the
two-dimensional spin one-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

"math/9207220","John W. Milnor","John W. Milnor","Local connectivity of Julia sets: expository lectures",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1992/11","math.DS",,"  The following notes provide an introduction to recent work of Branner,
Hubbard and Yoccoz on the geometry of polynomial Julia sets. They are an
expanded version of lectures given in Stony Brook in Spring 1992. I am indebted
to help from the audience.
  Section 1 describes unpublished work by J.-C. Yoccoz on local connectivity of
quadratic Julia sets. It presents only the ""easy"" part of his work, in the
sense that it considers only non-renormalizable polynomials, and makes no
effort to describe the much more difficult arguments which are needed to deal
with local connectivity in parameter space. It is based on second hand sources,
namely Hubbard together with lectures by Branner and Douady. Hence the
presentation is surely quite different from that of Yoccoz.
  Section 2 describes the analogous arguments used by Branner and Hubbard to
study higher degree polynomials for which all but one of the critical orbits
escape to infinity. In this case, the associated Julia set J is never locally
connected. The basic problem is rather to decide when J is totally
disconnected. This Branner-Hubbard work came before Yoccoz, and its technical
details are not as difficult. However, in these notes their work is presented
simply as another application of the same geometric ideas.
  Chapter 3 complements the Yoccoz results by describing a family of examples,
due to Douady and Hubbard (unpublished), showing that an infinitely
renormalizable quadratic polynomial may have non-locally-connected Julia set.
An Appendix describes needed tools from complex analysis, including the
Gr\""otzsch inequality.
