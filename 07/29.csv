to the Higgs sector. We focus on two examples: the charged Higgs mass in the
minimal supersymmetric model and the Higgs couplings to vector boson pairs. In
the first case, we find that in the absence of squark mixing a global
SU(2)$\times$SU(2) symmetry protects the charged Higgs mass from corrections of
${\cal O}(g^2m^4_t/m^2_W)$. In the second case, it is the {\it custodial}
symmetry which plays an analogous role in constraining the fermion-mass
dependence of the radiative corrections.

Freezing out variations in the modulus of the effective field yields a $U(1)$
sigma-model. A duality transformation on the sigma-model reduces the problem to
finding the Green function for a related electrostatics problem. This duality
illuminates the plasma analogy to the Laughlin wave function.

string theory backgrounds in which the usual decoupling of ghosts and matter
does not hold. Like ordinary string models, these can sometimes be given
space-time interpretations. For instance, three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge
theory can arise as a string theory. The world-sheet model in this case
involves a topological sigma model. Instanton contributions to the sigma model
give rise to Wilson line insertions in the space-time Chern-Simons theory. A
certain holomorphic analog of Chern-Simons theory can also arise as a string
theory.

reduce to the CGHS theory in the classical limit, can be written as a
Liouville-like theory. In a sub-class of this, the field space singularity
observed by several authors is absent, regardless of the number of matter
fields, and in addition it is such that the dilaton-gravity functional
integration range (the real line) transforms into itself for the Liouville
theory fields. We also discuss some problems associated with the usual
calculation of Hawking radiation, which stem from the neglect of back reaction.
We give an alternative argument incorporating back reaction but find that the
rate is still asymptotically constant. The latter is due to the fact that the
quantum theory does not seem to have a lower bound in energy and Hawking
radiation takes positive Bondi (or ADM) mass solutions to arbitrarily large
negative mass.
