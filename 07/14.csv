the spectrum of perturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance

inflation). If the tensor mode dominates at large-angular scales, then the
value of $\Delta T/T$ predicted on $1^\circ$ is less than if the scalar mode
dominates, and, for cold dark matter models, $b>1$ can be made consistent with
the COBE DMR results.

that gravity is likely to spoil the Peccei-Quinn solution of the strong CP
problem, and update earlier analyses showing that discrete symmetries can lead
to axions with suitable properties. Even if there are not suitable axions, we
note that string theory is a theory in which CP is spontaneously broken and
$\theta$ in principle calculable. $\theta$ thus might turn out to be small
