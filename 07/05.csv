pairwise interactions. At present, the $\Delta$ masses are poorly known from
experiments. Improvement of these data would provide an opportunity to make a
significant test of our understanding of electromagnetic and quark-mass
contributions to hadronic masses. The problem of determining resonance masses
from scattering and production data is discussed.
