  Surface","18 pages",,,,"cond-mat",,"  The pair interaction between magnetic flux lines in a semi-infinite slab of
an anisotropic type-II superconductor in an external field is derived in the
London limit. The case where the applied field is normal to the
superconductor/vacuum interface is considered. The presence of stray fields
near the surface leads to an additional contribution to the repulsive
interaction between flux lines that vanishes exponentially with the distance
from the interface. The pair interaction is used to obtain the continuum
elastic energy of a distorted semi-infinite flux-line array. The presence of
the superconductor/vacuum interface yields surface contributions to the
compressional and tilt elastic constants.

discretized random surface with extrinsic curvature embedded in a
three-dimensional space. The use of the toroidal topology enables us to enforce
the non-zero external extension without the necessity of defining a boundary
and allows us to measure directly the string tension. We show that a phase
transition from the crumpled phase to the smooth phase observed earlier for a
spherical topology appears also for a toroidal surface for the same finite
value of the coupling constant of the extrinsic curvature term. The phase
transition is characterized by the vanishing of the string tension. We discuss
the possible non-trivial continuum limit of the theory, when approaching the
critical point. Numerically we find a value of the critical exponent $\n$ to be
between .38 and .42. The specific heat, related to the extrinsic curvature term
seems not to diverge (or diverge slower than logarithmically) at the critical
point.

asymmetry then baryon- or lepton-number violating processes are constrained by
the condition that they do not subsequently erase this asymmetry. We present a
revision of the analysis of sphaleron baryon-number violating processes in the
standard model including lepton-mass effects. We find the surprising result
that a GUT-scale matter-asymmetry can survive the $B$ and $L$ violating
sphaleron interactions even though ($B- L$) is conserved and equals zero for
all temperatures. We extend the analysis to cover the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM) and also derive the constraints on the R-parity violating
couplings in extensions of the MSSM. In the case of the baryon number violating
dimension 4 operators we find, contrary to current wisdom, that the resulting
bounds can be avoided completely because of a residual lepton-flavour number
conservation; in the case of lepton number violating operators we find the
bounds are flavour dependent and can be avoided completely in definite flavour
channels. We also consider how the bounds are modified in the case there is a
Grand Unified extension of the supersymmetric model which introduces new lepton
flavour violating couplings.
