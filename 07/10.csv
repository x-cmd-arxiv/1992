are noted.

convective instability in a non-Boussinesq fluid. It is shown that many of the
features observed in convection experiments conducted on $CO_{2}$ gas can be
reproduced by using a generalized two-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation. The
formation of hexagonal patterns, rolls and spirals is studied, as well as the
transitions and competition among them. We also study nucleation and growth of
hexagonal patterns and find that the front velocity in this two dimensional
model is consistent with the prediction of marginal stability theory for one
dimensional fronts.

Iori, Marinari and Parisi to describe some of the features of protein folding
mechanisms. We study how the (folded) shape of the chain evolves in time. We
find that for short times the mean square distance (squared) between chain
configurations evolves according to a power law, $D \sim t ^\nu$. We discuss
the influence of the quenched disorder (represented by the randomness of the
coupling constants in the Lennard-Jones potential) on value of the critical
exponent. We find that $\nu$ decreases from $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ when
the strength of the quenched disorder increases.

Standard Model, in which a gauge singlet superfield is added to the Higgs
sector. We show that the order of the transition is determined by the trilinear
soft supersymmetry breaking terms rather than by the $O ( m^{3} T )$ term in
the 1-loop, $T\neq0$ corrections. This fact removes the Standard Model upper
bound on the Higgs mass, $ m_{H} < 55 GeV$, coming from the requirement that
baryon asymmetry is not washed out by anomalous electroweak processes. We
perform a numerical analysis of parameter space including in the effective
potential top-stop contribution to 1-loop radiative corrections. We find that
this model is compatible with the preservation of baryon asymmetry for masses
of the lightest scalar up to about 170 GeV.
