to their maps to the symplectic group. The main result is that the natural map
from the unipotent (a.k.a. Malcev) completion of the Torelli group to the
prounipotent radical of the Sp_g completion of the mapping class group is a non
trivial central extension with kernel isomorphic to Q, at least when g \ge 8.
The theorem is proved by relating the central extension to the line bundle
associated to the archemidean height of the cycle C - C- in the Jacobian of the
curve C. We also develop some of the basic theory of relative completions.

one-dimensional Hubbard model with arbitrary degeneracy $N$. Using the
integrability of this model by Bethe Ansatz we are able to compute the spectrum
of the low-lying excitations in a large but finite box for arbitrary values of
the electron density and of the Coulomb interaction. This information is used
to determine the asymptotic behaviour of correlation functions at zero
temperature in the presence of external fields lifting the degeneracy. The
critical exponents depend on the system parameters through a $N\times N$
dressed charge matrix implying the relevance of the interaction of charge- and
spin-density waves.

global monopoles and in which the dark matter is cold has several interesting
features. The model is normalized by choosing its single parameter within the
bounds obtained from gravitational wave constraints and by demanding coherent
velocity f1ows of about 600km/sec on scales of $50 h^{-1} Mpc$. Using this
normalization, the model predicts the existence of dominant structures with
mass $2\times 10^{16} M_\odot$ on a scale $35 h^{-1}Mpc$ i.e. larger than the
horizon at $t_{eq}$. The magnitude of the predicted mass function in the
galactic mass range is in good agreement with the observed Schechter function.

collapse which is the key feature of global texture appears in several field
theory models with broken global O(N) symmetry. Such models do not necessarily
have nontrivial third homotopy group of the vacuum manifold but may give rise
to collapsing global field configurations with properties similar to textures.
It is verified that configurations with planar and cylindrical geometries do
not collapse. The existence of critical parameters for collapse of spherically
symmetric global field configurations is verified both analytically and
numerically.

construction which applies to the case of the reduction of a poisson manifold
by a submanifold. In the case of symplectic reduction, our procedure
generalizes the usual classical BRST construction which only applies to
symplectic reduction of a symplectic manifold by a coisotropic submanifold,
\ie\ the case of reducible ``first class'' constraints. In particular, our
procedure yields a method to deal with ``second-class'' constraints. We
construct the BRST complex and compute its cohomology. BRST cohomology vanishes
for negative dimension and is isomorphic as a poisson algebra to the algebra of
smooth functions on the reduced poisson manifold in zero dimension. We then
show that in the general case of reduction of poisson manifolds, BRST
cohomology cannot be identified with the cohomology of vertical differential
forms.
