  $H_{c2}$","27 pages (no figures); in REVTEX",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.47.2715",,"cond-mat",,"  We study the flux-flow Hall effect and thermomagnetic transport near the
upper critical field \hctwo\ in extreme type-II superconductors starting from a
suitable generalization of the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. We
explicitly incorporate the effects of backflow into the calculations of the
local electric field and current, leading to a current which is properly
divergenceless. The Hall conductivity calculated from this current agrees with
other mean-field calculations which assume a uniform applied electric field
(the Schmid-Caroli-Maki solution), thereby vindicating these simplified
treatments. We then use these results to calculate the transverse
thermomagnetic effects (the Ettingshausen and Nernst effects). The effects of
thermal fluctuations and nonlocal elasticity of the flux lattice are
incorporated using a method recently developed by Vecris and Pelcovits [G.
Vecris and R. A. Pelcovits, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 44}, 2767 (1991)]. Our results,
taken together with those of Vecris and Pelcovits, provide a rather complete
description of the transport properties of the flux lattice state near \hctwo,
at least within the framework of time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory.

of the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, in which the order parameter
relaxation time is taken to be complex. Using a method due to Gor'kov and
Kopnin, we derive an equation of motion for a single vortex ($B\ll H_{c2}$) in
the presence of an applied transport current. The imaginary part of the
relaxation time and the normal state Hall effect both break ``particle-hole
symmetry,'' and produce a component of the vortex velocity parallel to the
transport current, and consequently a Hall field due to the vortex motion.
Various models for the relaxation time are considered, allowing for a
comparison to some phenomenological models of vortex motion in superconductors,
such as the Bardeen-Stephen and Nozi\`eres-Vinen models, as well as to models
of vortex motion in neutral superfluids. In addition, the transport energy,
Nernst effect, and thermopower are calculated for a single vortex. Vortex
bending and fluctuations can also be included within this description,
resulting in a Langevin equation description of the vortex motion. The Langevin
equation is used to discuss the propagation of helicon waves and the
diffusional motion of a vortex line. The results are discussed in light of the
rather puzzling sign change of the Hall effect which has been observed in the
mixed state of the high temperature superconductors.

that their numbers should become equal with increasing energy, it has recently
been proposed that there must exist exotic mesons with masses just above 1.7
GeV in order to fill the deficit. We demonstrate that a string-like picture is
actually consistent with the present numbers of baryon and meson states, and in
fact predicts regular oscillations in their ratio. This suggests a different
role for new hadronic states.

undergoes a second-order phase transition from $D=1$ to $D=0$ behaviour.
Non-trivial windings of the closed loops in a graph around the compactified
time direction are interpreted as vortices. The critical point has a natural
interpretation as the temperature at which these vortices condense and disorder
the system. We show that the vortex density increases rapidly in the critical
region indicating the breakdown of the dilute vortex gas approximation at this
point. We discuss the relation of this phenomenon to the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the $D=1$ matrix model formulated

polarizes the surrounding vacuum, unless the effective cosmological constant of
the effective stringy action diverges.
