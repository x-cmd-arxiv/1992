D47 (1993) 3059-3062","10.1103/PhysRevD.47.3059",,"hep-ph",,"  Decay constants of $D$ and $B$ mesons are estimated within the framework of a
heavy-quark approach using measured isospin mass splittings in the $D$, $D^*$,
and $B$ states to isolate the electromagnetic hyperfine interaction between
quarks. The values $f_D = (262 \pm 29)$ MeV and $f_B = (160 \pm 17)$ MeV are
obtained. Only experimental errors are given; possible theoretical ambiguities,
and suggestions for reducing them, are noted.
