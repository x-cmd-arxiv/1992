confining the particles in a weak harmonic potential instead of using a finite
box or periodic boundary conditions. There is, however, a slightly different
connection between partition functions and thermodynamic quantities with such
volume regularization. This is made explicit, and its origin explained to be
due to the system having a space-varying density in an external potential.
Beyond perturbation theory there is a potential pitfall with the method, which
is pointed out.

found: For a critical model with fundamental Hamiltonian H(phi), absence of

oscillation parameters are obtained from the existing solar neutrino data,
including the recent GALLEX and Kamiokande III results. (1) A purely
astrophysical solution to the solar neutrino problem is strongly disfavored by
the data: the best fit in a cooler Sun model requires an 8% reduction in T_c,
but the chi-sqaured test rejects this hypothesis at 99.99% C.L., suggesting new
neutrino physics. (2) Assuming the Standard Solar Model (SSM) and MSW
oscillations, the MSW parameters are constrained to two small regions: one in
the non-adiabatic region and the other in the large-mixing region. The
non-adiabatic solution gives a considerably better fit. For nu_e oscillations
into sterile neutrinos, the allowed region (90%) is constrained to non-
adiabatic oscillations. As long as the SSM is assumed, the neutrino mixing
angles are at least four times larger, or considerably smaller, than the
corresponding quark mixing angles. (3) Allowing both MSW oscillations and a
non-standard core temperature, a) the experiments determine the core
temperature at the 5% level, yielding a value consistent with the SSM
prediction. b) When T_c is used as a free parameter, the allowed MSW region is
broadened: a cooler Sun (T_c=0.95) allows mass and mixing implied by the SUSY
SO(10) GUT, while a warmer Sun (T_c=1.05) allows parameter space suggested by
intermediate-scale SO(10) GUTs. Superstring-inspired models are consistent with
all solutions. (4) From the narrowed parameter space, we predict the neutrino
spectral shape which should be observed in SNO. Throughout the calculation we
use the latest Bahcall-Pinsonneault SSM, and include nuclear and astrophysical
uncertainties in a simplified, but physically transparent way.

inclusive nonleptonic and semileptonic decays of heavy flavour hadrons. These
effects give rise to powerlike corrections $\propto 1/m_Q^n\,$, $n \ge 2$ with
$m_Q$ denoting the heavy quark mass.The leading correction to the semileptonic
branching ratio occurs for n=2. It is expressed in terms of the
vector-pseudoscalar mass splitting: $\delta BR\ind{sl}/BR\ind{sl} \simeq
BR\ind{nl}\, \cdot \,6\,(\,(M_V^2-M_P^2)/m_Q^2)\cdot (c_+^2 - c_-^2)/2N_c$ and
yields a {\it reduction} of $BR\ind{sl}$. This nonperturbative correction
contributes to the nonleptonic width with a sign opposite to that of the
perturbative terms that are non-leading in $1/N_c$. In beauty decays the former
reduces the latter by 20 \% whereas in charm decays they more or less cancel.
This leads to a {\it reduction} of $BR\ind{sl}$ by no more than 10 \% in beauty
decays and by a factor of roughly two in charm decays. We confront these
results with those obtained from phenomenological models of heavy flavour
decays and find that such models are unable to mimic these leading corrections
by a specific choice of quark masses or by invoking Fermi motion.

in its usual formulation requires an infinite number of fields---can be

almost obvious fact that the hierarchy described by the two bosons is not the

incompatible with the reduction to the KdV-type subhierarchies.
