and Stell is studied using mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations.
Surfactant directional degrees of freedom are summed out exactly before
mean-field theory is applied, and the resulting phase diagrams are much
improved compared with previous mean-field results. The critical line and
tricritical point is located using Monte Carlo simulations and finite size
scaling.

interactions are important can excite electron-hole pairs near the Fermi level.
We use a simple model to study the associated nonequilibrium properties and
found two novel effects: (i) for junctions with electrodes of the same
electronic properties, a leakage current exists within the Coulomb gap even
when the environmental impedance is infinite; (ii) for junctions with
electrodes of different electronic properties, the differential conductance
diverges when a net interaction between conduction electrons is attractive, and
it is strongly suppressed for a net repulsive interaction.

$V'=W',Z'$ and $V=W,Z$ is a useful diagnostic of $V'$ gauge couplings at future
hadron colliders. For $M_{Z'}\simeq1$ TeV it would allow determination of
combinations of $Z'$ gauge couplings to the quarks to around 10 percent. An
analysis of the extraction of gauge couplings from the complementary tests:
forward-backward asymmetry, rare decays $pp\to V'\to f_1{\bar f_2}V$, and the
production cross section $pp\to V'V$ is given in a model-independent framework.
Four ratios of charges are needed to characterize a general gauge theory with
an additional family-independent $U_1'$ factor. We show that there are four
functions of these ratios observable at hadron colliders, but for projected SSC
and LHC luminosities only two combinations can be extracted. These yield a
significant discrimination between interesting GUT-motivated models. Clean
tests of whether a new $W'$ couples to right-handed currents, of the ratio
$g_R/g_L$ of gauge couplings, and of the non-abelian vertex in left-right
symmetric models are described.
