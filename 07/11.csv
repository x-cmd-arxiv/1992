  Dimensions","32 pages",,"10.1007/BF02198153",,"cond-mat",,"  An essentially exact solution of the infinite dimensional Hubbard model is
made possible by using a self-consistent mapping of the Hubbard model in this
limit to an effective single impurity Anderson model. Solving the latter with
quantum Monte Carlo procedures enables us to obtain exact results for the one
and two-particle properties of the infinite dimensional Hubbard model. In
particular we find antiferromagnetism and a pseudogap in the single-particle
density of states for sufficiently large values of the intrasite Coulomb
interaction at half filling. Both the antiferromagnetic phase and the
insulating phase above the N\'eel temperature are found to be quickly
suppressed on doping. The latter is replaced by a heavy electron metal with a
quasiparticle mass strongly dependent on doping as soon as $n<1$. At half
filling the antiferromagnetic phase boundary agrees surprisingly well in shape
and order of magnitude with results for the three dimensional Hubbard model.

description of photon production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation is given. It is
pointed out that in a well-defined perturbative analysis it is necessary to
subtract the quark-photon collinear singularities. This subtraction requires
the introduction of an unphysical parameter in the perturbative part of the
cross section. The subtracted term is factored into non-perturbative
fragmentation function. The dependence on the unphysical parameter cancels in
the sum of non-perturbative and perturbative parts. It is pointed out that for
$E_{\gamma}\le \sqrt{s}/(2(1+\epsilon_c))$ the non-perturbative contributions
are suppressed. Using a general purpose next-to-leading order Monte Carlo
program, we calculate various physical quantities that were measured in LEP
experiments recently.

supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the framework of minimal $N=1$ Supergravity
models with radiative breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry. To this end,
we re--calculate the cross sections for all possible annihilation processes for
a general, mixed neutralino state with arbitrary mass. Our analysis includes
effects of all Yukawa couplings of third generation fermions, and allows for a
fairly general set of soft SUSY breaking parameters at the Planck scale. We
find that a cosmologically interesting relic density emerges naturally over
wide regions of parameter space. However, the requirement that relic
neutralinos do not overclose the universe does not lead to upper bounds on SUSY
breaking parameters that are strictly valid for all combinations of parameters
and of interest for existing or planned collider experiments; in particular,
gluino and squark masses in excess of 5 TeV cannot strictly be excluded. On the
other hand, in the ``generic'' case of a gaugino--like neutralino whose
annihilation cross sections are not ``accidentally'' enhanced by a nearby Higgs
or $Z$ pole, all sparticles should lie within the reach of the proposed $pp$
and $e^+e^-$ supercolliders. We also find that requiring the LSP to provide all
dark matter predicted by inflationary models imposes a strict lower bound of 40
GeV on the common scalar mass $m$ at the Planck scale, while the lightest
sleptons would have to be heavier

is investigated. Working in conformal gauge about a fixed background metric,
the theory may be viewed as a sigma model whose target space is parameterized
by the dilaton $\phi$ and conformal factor $\rho$. A precise connection is
given between the constraint that the theory be independent of the background
metric and conformal invariance of the resulting sigma model. Although the
action is renormalizable, new coupling constants must be specified at each
order in perturbation theory in order to determine the quantum theory. These
constants may be viewed as initial data for the beta function equations. It is
argued that not all choices of this data correspond to physically sensible
theories of gravity, and physically motivated constraints on the data are
discussed. In particular a recently constructed subclass of initial data which
reduces the full quantum theory to a soluble Liouville-like theory has energies
unbounded from below and thus is unphysical. Possibilities for modifying this
construction so as to avoid this difficulty are briefly discussed.

"math/9207201",,"Marco Abate and Giorgio Patrizio","Holomorphic curvature of Finsler metrics and complex geodesics",,,,,"math.CV",,"  In his famous 1981 paper, Lempert proved that given a point in a strongly
convex domain the complex geodesics (i.e., the extremal disks) for the
Kobayashi metric passing through that point provide a very useful fibration of
the domain. In this paper we address the question whether, given a smooth
complex Finsler metric on a complex manifold, it is possible to give purely
differential geometric properties of the metric ensuring the existence of such
a fibration in complex geodesics of the manifold. We first discuss at some
length the notion of holomorphic sectional curvature for a complex Finsler
metric; then, using the differential equation of complex geodesics we obtained
in a previous paper, we show that for every pair (point, tangent vector) there
is a (only a segment if the metric is not complete) complex geodesic passing
through the point tangent to the given vector iff the Finsler metric is
K\""ahler, has constant holomorphic sectional curvature -4 and satisfies a
simmetry condition on the curvature tensor. Finally, we show that a complex
Finsler metric of constant holomorphic sectional curvature -4 satisfying the
given simmetry condition on the curvature is necessarily the Kobayashi metric.

"math/9207202",,"Evgeny A. Poletsky","Sequences of analytic disks",,,,,"math.CV",,"  The subject considered in this paper has, at least, three points of interest.
Suppose that we have a sequence of one-dimensional analytic varieties in a
domain in $\Bbb C^n$. The cluster of this sequence consists from all points in
the domains such that every neighbourhood of such points intersects with
infinitely many different varieties. The first question is: what analytic
properties does the cluster inherit from varieties? We give a sufficient
criterion when the cluster contains an analytic disk, but it follows from
examples of Stolzenberg and Wermer that, in general, clusters can contain no
analytic disks. So we study algebras of continuous function on clusters, which
can be approximated by holomorphic functions or polynomials, and show that this
algebras possess some analytic properties in all but explicitly pathological
and uninteresting cases. Secondly, we apply and results about clusters to
polynomial hulls and maximal functions, finding remnants of analytic structures
there too. And, finally, due to more and more frequent appearances of analytic
disks as tools in complex analysis, it seems to be interesting to look at their
sequences to establish terminology, basic notation and properties.
