growth mechanism involves interface hopping and pairwise annihilation
supplemented by spontaneous creation of the stable-phase, +1, regions by
overturning the unstable-phase, -1, spins with probability p. For cluster
coarsening at phase coexistence, p=0, the conventional structure-factor scaling
applies. In this limit our model falls in the class of diffusion-limited
reactions A+A->inert. The +1 cluster size grows diffusively, ~t**(1/2), and the
two-point correlation function obeys scaling. However, for p>0, i.e., for the
dynamics of formation of stable phase from unstable phase, we find that
structure-factor scaling breaks down; the length scale associated with the size
of the growing +1 clusters reflects only the short-distance properties of the
two-point correlations.

surprise since the theory is presumably trivial. By taking this cutoff into
account, we find that the $\rho$ parameter can take values only within a
limited range and has finite ambiguities that are suppressed by inverse powers
of the cutoff scale, the so called ``scaling--violations"". We find that large
deviations from the perturbative results are possible, but only when the cutoff
effects are also large.

according to the experimentally observed branching ratios. The ratios of the

of two-dimensional gravity coupled to matter. The standard DDK formulation is
recovered by splitting the topological generators into $c=-26$
reparametrization ghosts+matter +`Liouville', while a similar splitting
involving $c=-2$ ghosts gives rise to the matter dressed in exactly the way
required in order that the theory be equivalent to Virasoro constraints on the
KP hierarchy. The two dressings of matter with the `Liouville' differ also by
their `ghost numbers', which is similar to the existence of representatives of
BRST cohomologies with different ghost numbers. The topological central charge
$\ctop\neq3$ provides a two-fold covering of the allowed region $d\leq1\cup
d\geq25$ of the matter central charge $d$ via $d=(\ctop+1)(\ctop+6)/(\ctop-3)$.
The `Liouville' field is identified as the ghost-free part of the topological
$U(1)$ current. The construction thus allows one to establish a direct relation
(presumably an equivalence) between the Virasoro-constrained KP hierarchies,
minimal models, and the BRST invariance condition for highest-weight states of
the topological algebra.

cone gauge tests the reparametrization symmetry needed to fix this gauge. The
full conformal symmetry gives stronger constraints than the Poincar\'e
subalgebra. We find that the symmetry may be preserved in any space-time
dimension, but only if the spectrum is drastically reduced (part of this
reduction is natural in a zero tension limit of the ordinary string spectrum).
The quantum states are required to be symmetric ({\it i.e.} singlets) under
space-time diffeomorphisms, except for the centre of mass wave function.

corresponding quantum theory can be solved exactly, since it reduces to a
problem of finding the cohomology of a free-field Virasoro algebra. In the
non-compact case, which is relevant for 2d black holes, this construction is
likely to break down, since the most general field configuration cannot be
expanded into Fourier modes. Strategy for circumventing this problem is
discussed.
