devised by us for simulations of SOS models, to the BCSOS model. It is the
first time that a cluster algorithm is used for a model with constraints. The
performance of this new algorithm is studied in detail in both phases of the
model, including a finite size scaling analysis of the autocorrelations.

liquid. Using critical droplet theory and experimental data for Cu, we explain
the thermodynamics of the coexistence region. The width of the transition
scales as (Number of particles) to the power (-1/4).

is considered at finite temperature, in the large $N$ approximation. Using an
approximate treatment of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion
self-energy, we find that chiral symmetry is restored above a certain critical
temperature which depends itself on $N$. We find that the ratio of the
zero-momentum zero-temperature fermion mass to the critical temperature has a
large value compared with four-fermion theories, as had been suggested in a
previous work with a momentum-independent self-energy. Evidence of a
temperature- dependent critical $N$ is shown to appear in this approximation.
The phase diagram for spontaneous mass generation in the theory is presented in
$T-N$ space.

rise to primordial density fluctuations which deviate logarithmically from the
scale free Harrison - Zeldovich spectrum. We consider a number of such examples
and, in each case we normalize the amplitude of the fluctuations with the
recent COBE measurement of the microwave background anisotropy. The predictions
for the bulk velocities as well as anisotropies on smaller (~1-2 degrees)
angular scales are compared with the Harrison-Zeldovich case. Deviations from
the latter range from a few to about 15 percent. We also estimate the redshift
beyond which the quasars would not be expected to be seen. The inflationary
quasar cutoff redshifts can vary by as much as 25\% from the Harrison-Zeldovich
case. We find that the inflationary scenario provides a good starting point for
a theory of large scale structure in the universe provided the dark matter is a
combination of cold plus (~10-30 \%) hot components.
