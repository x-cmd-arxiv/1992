the topological susceptibility and the string tension . We perfomed numerical
simulations at N=4 and N=10. In order to test the universality, we adopted two
different lattice formulations. Scaling and universality tests led to the
conclusion that at N=10 the geometrical approach gives a good definition of
lattice topological susceptibility. On the other hand, N=4 proved not to be
large enough to suppress the unphysical configurations, called dislocations,
contributing to the topological susceptibility. We obtained other
determinations of the topological susceptibility by the field theoretical
method, wich relies on a local definition of the lattice topological charge
density, and the cooling method. They gave quite consistent results, showing
scaling and universality. The large-N expansion predicts an exponential area
law behavior for sufficiently large Wilson loops, which implies confinement,
due to the dynamical matter fields and absence of the screening phenomenon. We
determined the string tension, without finding evidence of screening effects.

technicolor interactions. This model is unusual in that it can provide a heavy
top quark without generating large flavor-changing neutral currents. Our work
focuses on the model's phenomenology, particularly the oblique electroweak
radiative corrections. We demonstrate that while oblique corrections and FCNC
effects limit the allowed parameter space, the model remains viable. In
particular, if the scalar is relatively heavy, the model can accommodate a wide
range of top quark masses.

proving to be optimal. The renormalization generalizes the ""autonomous""
renormalization for lambda-phi^4 theory and requires a particular relationship
between the bare gauge coupling e_B and the bare scalar self- coupling
lambda_B. When both couplings are small, then lambda is proportional to e^4 and
the scalar/vector mass-squared ratio is of order e^2, as in the classic 1-loop
analysis of Coleman and Weinberg. However, as lambda increases, e reaches a
maximum value and then decreases, and in this ""nonperturbative"" regime the
Higgs scalar can be much heavier than the vector boson. We compare our results
to the autonomously renormalized 1-loop effective potential, finding many
similarities. The main phenomenological implication is a Higgs mass of about 2
TeV.

charge therefore acts physically as an electric charge. The topologically
nontrivial, electrically charged sector contains massless quantum states
orthogonal to the vacuum in spite of the absence of classical topological
solutions. These states are created by a gauge invariant local operator and can
be interpreted as coherent states of photons. The obtainment of a quantity like
charge, which is usually associated with matter, as a property of some peculiar
states of the gauge field points towards the possibility of describing both the
matter and the fields which mediate its interactions within the same unified
