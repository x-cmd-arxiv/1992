  Blockade","33 pages, 10 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.47.1967",,"cond-mat",,"  We compute the zero frequency current noise numerically and in several limits
analytically for the coulomb blockade problem consisting of two tunnel
junctions connected in series. At low temperatures over a wide range of
voltages, capacitances, and resistances it is shown that the noise measures the
variance in the number of electrons in the region between the two tunnel
junctions. The average current, on the other hand, only measures the mean
number of electrons. Thus, the noise provides additional information about
transport in these devices which is not available from measuring the current
alone.

Ashtekar's new variables formulation of gravity. A first order action
functional for this system is derived in which the field variables are a tetrad
field, and an SL(2,C) connection, together with the scalar field. The tetrad
field and the SL(2,C) connection are related to the Ashtekar variables for the
vacuum case by a conformal transformation. A canonical analysis shows that for
this coupling the equations of Ashtekar's formulation of canonical gravity are
non-polynomial in the scalar field. (to be published in Phys. Rev. D)

theory. Earlier performed observations of a change in the Chern-Simons number
are supplemented with a measurement of the lowest eigenvalues of the
three-dimensional staggered fermion Dirac operator and observations of the
spatial extension of energy lumps associated with the transition. The
observations corroborate on the interpretation of the change in Chern-Simons
numbers as representing continuum physics, not lattice artifacts. By combining
the various observations it is possible to follow in considerable detail the
time-history of thermal fluctuations of the classical gauge-field
configurations responsible for the change in the Chern-Simons number.

be evaluated by one of two techniques: either one estimates spectral function
integrals using scaled QCD data, or one uses naive dimensional analysis with a
chiral Lagrangian. The former yields corrections to electroweak parameters
proportional to the number of flavors and the number of colors, while the
latter is proportional to the number of flavors squared and is independent of
the number of colors. We attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by
showing that the spectrum of technicolor one obtains by scaling QCD data to
high energies is unlikely to resemble that of an actual technicolor theory. The
resonances are likely to be much lighter than naively supposed and the
radiative corrections to electroweak parameters may by much larger. We also
argue that much less is known about the spectrum and the radiative corrections
in technicolor than was previously believed.

former case physics does not depend on $\theta$; while the latter exhibits an
explicit $\theta$- dependence. The crucial difference is due to the
observation, that the pseudoparticles of 4d gluodynamics possess an aditional
