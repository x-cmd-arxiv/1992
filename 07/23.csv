spacetime metric and antisymmetric tensor fields, we reconsider gravity
theories constructed from a nonsymmetric metric. We first show that all such
""geometrical"" theories homogeneous in second derivatives violate standard
physical requirements: ghost-freedom, absence of algebraic inconsistencies or
continuity of degree-of-freedom content. This no-go result applies in
particular to the old unified theory of Einstein and its recent avatars.
However, we find that the addition of nonderivative, ``cosmological'' terms
formally restores consistency by giving a mass to the antisymmetric tensor
field, thereby transmuting it into a fifth-force-like massive vector but with
novel possible matter couplings. The resulting macroscopic models also exhibit
``van der Waals''-type gravitational effects, and may provide useful
phenomenological foils to general relativity.

metrics using Ashtekar's hamiltonian formulation of the theory. In this letter,
we show that a natural alternative choice for the form of the hamiltonian
constraints leads to a theory which agrees with GR for non-degenerate metrics,
but differs in the degenerate sector from Ashtekar's original degenerate
extension. The Poisson bracket algebra of the alternative constraints closes in
the non-degenerate sector, with structure functions that involve the {\it
inverse} of the spatial triad. Thus, the algebra does {\it not} close in the
degenerate sector. We find that it must be supplemented by an infinite number
ofsecondary constraints, which are shown to be first class (although their
explicit form is not worked out in detail). All of the constraints taken
together are implied by, but do not imply, Ashtekar's original form of
constraints. Thus, the alternative constraints give rise to a different
degenerate extension of GR. In the corresponding quantum theory, the single
loop and intersecting loop holonomy states found in the connection
representation satisfy {\it all} of the constraints. These states are therefore
exact (formal) solutions to this alternative degenerate extension of quantum
gravity, even though they are {\it not} solutions to the usual vector
constraint.

relativity. Here, the underlying reason for the time-independence of the
holonomy group is traced to the self-duality of the curvature 2-form for an
Einstein space. This observation reveals that the holonomy group is
time-independent not only in vacuum, but also in the presence of a cosmological
constant. It also shows that once matter is coupled to gravity, the
""conservation of holonomy"" is lost. When the fundamental group of space is
non-trivial, the holonomy group need not be connected. For each homotopy class
of loops, the holonomies comprise a coset of the full holonomy group modulo its
connected component. These cosets are also time-independent. All possible
holonomy groups that can arise are classified, and examples are given of
connections with these holonomy groups. The classification of local and global
solutions with given holonomy groups is discussed.

quarks on 12^3x6 lattices. We have studied the crossover between the high and
low temperature regimes for three values of the hopping parameter, kappa=0.16,
0.17, and 0.18. At each of these values of kappa we have carried out spectrum
calculations on 12^3x24 lattices for two values of the gauge coupling in the
vicinity of the crossover in order to set an energy scale for our
thermodynamics calculations and to determine the critical value of the gauge
coupling for which the pion and quark masses vanish. For kappa=0.17 and 0.18 we
find coexistence between the high and low temperature regimes over 1,000
simulation time units indicating either that the equilibration time is
extremely long or that there is a possibility of a first order phase
transition. The pion mass is large at the crossover values of the gauge
coupling, but the crossover curve has moved closer to the critical curve along
which the pion and quark masses vanish, than it was on lattices with four time
slices. In addition, values of the dimensionless quantity T_c/m_rho are in
closer agreement with those for staggered quarks than was the case at N_t=4. (A

Supersymmetric Standard Model (SSM) including the constraints from universal
soft supersymmetry breaking and radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry.
The latter is enforced by using the one-loop Higgs effective potential which
automatically gives the one-loop corrected Higgs boson masses. We perform an
exhaustive search of the allowed five-dimensional parameter space and find that
the neutralino relic abundance $\Omega_\chi h^2_0$ depends most strongly on the
ratio $\xi_0\equiv m_0/m_{1/2}$. For $\xi_0\gg1$ the relic abundance is almost
always much too large, whereas for $\xi_0\ll1$ the opposite occurs. For
$\xi_0\sim1$ there are wide ranges of the remaining parameters for which
$\Omega_\chi\sim1$. We also determine that $m_{\tilde q}\gsim250\GeV$ and
$m_{\tilde l}\gsim100\GeV$ are necessary in order to possibly achieve
$\Omega_\chi\sim1$. These lower bounds are much weaker than the corresponding
ones derived previously when radiative breaking was {\it not} enforced.

solitons differ dramatically from semi-classical (perturbative) solitons
because fermion loop effects are important when the Yukawa coupling is strong.
We focus on kinks in a $(1+1)$--dimensional $\phi^4$ theory coupled to
fermions; a large-$N$ expansion is employed to treat the Yukawa coupling $g$
nonperturbatively. A local expression for the fermion vacuum energy is derived
using the WKB approximation for the Dirac eigenvalues. We find that fermion
loop corrections increase the energy of the kink and (for large $g$) decrease
its size. For large $g$, the energy of the quantum kink is proportional to $g$,
and its size scales as $1/g$, unlike the classical kink; we argue that these
features are generic to quantum solitons in theories with strong Yukawa
couplings. We also discuss the possible instability of fermions to solitons.
