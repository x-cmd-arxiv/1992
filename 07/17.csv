``updating on a last layer consisting of a single site''. It eliminates
critical slowing down in computations of bosonic and fermionic propagators in a
fixed volume. Here critical slowing down means divergence of asymptotic
relaxation times as the propagators approach criticality. A remaining volume
dependence is weak enough in case of bosons so that conjugate gradient can be
outperformed. However, no answer can be given yet if the same is true for
staggered fermions on lattices of realizable sizes. Numerical results are
presented for propagators of bosons and of staggered fermions in 4-dimensional

background radiation in the global monopole and texture models for cosmic
structure formation. We have evolved the six component linear gravitational
field along with the monopole or texture scalar fields numerically in an
expanding universe and performed the Sachs-Wolfe integrals directly on the
calculated gravitational fields. On scales $> 7^\circ$, we find a Gaussian
distribution with an approximately scale invariant fluctuation spectrum. The
$\Delta T/T$ amplitude is a factor of 4-5 larger than the prediction of the
standard CDM model with the same Hubble constant and density fluctuation
normalization. The recently reported COBE-DMR results imply that global
monopole and texture models require high bias factors or a large Hubble
constant in contrast to standard CDM which requires very low $H_0$ and bias
values. For $H_0 = 70 {\rm {km\over sec} Mpc^{-1}}$, we find that normalizing
to the COBE results implies $b_8 \simeq 3.2\pm 1.4$ (95\% c.l.). If we restrict
ourselves to the range of bias factors thought to be reasonable before the
announcement of the COBE results, $1.5 \lsim b_8 \lsim 2.5$, then it is fair to
conclude that global monopoles and textures are consistent with the COBE
results and are a {\it better} fit than Standard CDM.

\Lambda^4[1 \pm \cos(\phi/f)], naturally gives rise to inflation if $f \sim
M_{Pl}$ and $\Lambda \sim M_{GUT}$. We show how this can arise in
technicolor-like and superstring models, and work out an explicit string
example in the context of multiple gaugino condensation models. We study the
cosmology of this model in detail, and find that sufficient reheating to ensure
that baryogenesis can take place requires $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$. The primordial
density fluctuation spectrum generated is a non-scale-invariant power law,
$P(k) \propto k^{n_s}$, with $n_s \simeq 1 - (M^2_{Pl}/8\pi f^2)$, leading to
more power on large length scales than the $n_s = 1$ Harrison-Zeldovich
spectrum. The standard CDM model with $0 \la n_s \la 0.6-0.7$ could in
principle explain the large-scale clustering observed in the APM and IRAS
galaxy surveys as well as large-scale flows, but the COBE microwave anisotropy
implies such low amplitudes (or high bias factors, $b>2$) for these CDM models
that galaxy formation occurs too late to be viable; combining COBE with
sufficiently early galaxy formation or the large-scale flows leads to $n_s
>0.6$, or $f > 0.3 M_{Pl}$ as well. For extended and power law inflation
models, this constraint is even tighter, $n_s > 0.7$; combined with other
bounds on large bubbles in extended inflation, this leaves little room for most
extended models.
