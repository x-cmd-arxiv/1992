as a model for vortex line fluctuations in a high Tc superconductor. A density
of vortex lines of f=1/25 is considered. We find two sharp phase transitions.
The low T phase is an ordered vortex line lattice. The high T normal phase is a
vortex line liquid with much entangling, cutting, and loop excitations. An
intermediate phase is found which is characterized as a vortex line liquid of
disentangled lines. In this phase, the system displays superconducting
properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field, but normal behavior
in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field.

the infinite scalar self coupling $\lambda=\infty$ limit. Recent analytical and
numerical calculations at zero self coupling showed qualitatively different
phase diagram, raising the question of the $\lambda$ dependence of the phase
diagram. Here we use analytical (large $N_f$, perturbative and mean field)
approximations as well as numerical simulations to investigate the system.

sensitive to the particular form of the duality relations used to decontaminate
the sum rule predictions from the continuum contribution. Peculiarities of the
duality relations in the problem at hand are revealed. It is shown that the
proper requirements of duality and angular isotropy for S wave states lead to
an unambiguous form of the sum rules for the Isgur-Wise function. We illustrate
the constraints due to these requirements using a toy model of the harmonic
oscillator. The slope parameter and the shape of $\xi (y)$ are determined.

radiatively-induced electroweak symmetry breaking and presently available
experimental lower bounds on nucleon decay, impose severe constraints on the
available parameter space of the model which correspond to fine-tuning of the
model parameters of over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a
straightforward calculation of the cosmic relic density of neutralinos ($\chi$)
gives $\Omega_\chi h^2\gg1$ for most of the allowed parameter space in this
model, although small regions may still be cosmologically acceptable. We
finally discuss how the {\it no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity model}
avoids naturally the above troubles and thus constitutes a good candidate for
the low-energy effective supergravity model.

theories in the 1970's, have been turning up in recent studies of string
theory. First it was discovered that moduli spaces of toroidal compactification
are given by noncompact groups modded out by their maximal compact subgroups
and discrete duality groups. Then it was found that many other moduli spaces
have analogous descriptions. More recently, noncompact group symmetries have
turned up in effective actions used to study string cosmology and other
classical configurations. This paper explores these noncompact groups in the
case of toroidal compactification both from the viewpoint of low-energy
effective field theory, using the method of dimensional reduction, and from the
viewpoint of the string theory world sheet. The conclusion is that all these
symmetries are intimately related. In particular, we find that Chern--Simons
terms in the three-form field strength $H_{\mu\nu\rho}$ play a crucial role.

dimensional QCD. We start with a description of the ``abelian bosonization"".
The methods of the abelian bosonization are applied to several examples like
the Thirring model, the Schwinger model and QCD$_2$. The failure of this scheme
to handle flavored fermions is explained. Witten's non-abelian bosonization
rules are summarized including the generalization to the case of fermions with
color and flavor degrees of freedom. We discuss in details the bosonic version
of the mass bilinear of colored-flavored fermions in various schemes. The color
group is gauged and the full bosonized version of massive multiflavor QCD is
written down. The strong coupling limit is taken in the ``product scheme"" and
then in the $U(N_F\times N_C)$ scheme. Once the multiflavor $QCD_2$ action in
the interesting region of the low energies is written down, we extract the
semiclassical low lying baryonic spectrum. First classical soliton solutions of
the bosonic action are derived. Quantizing the flavor space around those
classical solutions produces the masses as well as the flavor properties of the
two dimensional baryons. In addition low lying multibaryonic solutions are
presented, as well as wave functions and matrix elements of interest, like
$q\bar q$ content.

which allow to determine the W-supercurrents of the conformal theories and we
compute their renormalized expressions. The analysis of the renormalization and
conservation of higher-spin currents is then performed for the corresponding
supersymmetric massive theories. We establish the quantum integrability of
these models and show that although their Lagrangian is not hermitian, the
masses of the fundamental particles are real, a property which is maintained by
one-loop corrections. The spectrum is actually much richer, since the theories
admit solitons. The existence of quantum conserved higher-spin charges implies
that elastic, factorized S-matrices can be constructed.
