"hep-lat/9206027",,"Jeffrey E. Mandula","Numerical Analysis of the Quark Fraction of the Proton Spin","8 pages, all in postscript",,,,"hep-lat hep-ph",,"  We report on a lattice QCD estimate of the quark spin fraction of the proton
spin. The estimate is arrived at by means of a lattice QCD simulation of the
polarized proton matrix element of the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly. The
preliminary result of the simulation is that this fraction is rather small.
This is in accord with the interpretation of the EMC experiment that the quark
spins are responsible for very little, if any, of the proton spin. (Talk given

a new solution to the strong CP problem with magnetic monopoles as originally
proposed by the author$^1$. Especially, we will discuss about the global
topological structure in the relevant gauge orbit spaces to be clarified. As it
is shown that in non-abelian gauge theories with a $\theta$ term, the induced
gauge orbit space with gauge potentials and gauge functions restricted on the
space boundary $S^2$ has a magnetic monopole structure and the gauge orbit
space has a vortex structure if there is a magnetic monopole in the ordinary
space. The Dirac's quantization conditions in the quantum theories ensure that
the vacuum angle $\theta$ in the gauge theories must be quantized. The
quantization rule is given by $\theta=2\pi/n~(n\neq 0)$ with n being the
topological charge of the magnetic monopole. Therefore, the strong CP problem
is automatically solved in the presence of a magnetic monopole of charge $\pm
1$ with $\theta=\pm 2\pi$, or magnetic monopoles of very large total
topological charge ($|n|\geq 10^92\pi$) if it is consistent with the abundance
of magnetic monopoles. Where in the first case with a magnetic monopole of
topological charge 1 or -1, we mean the strong CP-violation can be only very
small by the measurements implemented so far. Since $\theta=\pm 2\pi$
correspond to different monopole sectors, the CP can not be conserved exactly
in strong interactions in this case. In the second case, the strong CP cannot
be conserved either for large but finite n. The fact that the strong
CP-violation measured so far can be only so small or vanishing may be a signal
for the existence of magnetic monopoles. We also conjecture that the parity
violation and CP violation in weak interaction fundamentally may intimately

fermionic} gaussian model, the compactification radius of the boson underlying
both theories depending on the SG/MT coupling. (These two families of conformal
field theories are related by a ``twist''.) Corresponding SG and MT models
contain a subset of fields with identical correlation functions, but each model
also has fields the other one does not, e.g. the fermion fields of MTM are not
contained in SGM, and the {\it bosonic} soliton fields of SGM are not in MTM.
Our results imply, in particular, that the SGM at the so-called ``free-Dirac
point'' $\beta^2 = 4\pi$ is actually a theory of two interacting bosons with
diagonal S-matrix $S=-1$, and that for arbitrary couplings the overall sign of
the accepted SG S-matrix in the soliton sector should be reversed. More
generally, we draw attention to the existence of new classes of quantum field
theories, analogs of the (perturbed) fermionic gaussian models, whose partition
functions are invariant only under a subgroup of the modular group. One such
class comprises ``fermionic versions'' of the Virasoro minimal models.

Frobenius. This is then used to discuss bundles and connections in the

neighborhood theorem which says that a (not necessarily simple) closed geodesic

a lower bound for the length of a closed geodesic having crossing number $k$ on
a hyperbolic surface. This lower bound tends to infinity with $k$. Our second
generalization is to totally geodesic hypersurfaces of hyperbolic manifolds.
Namely, we construct a tubular neighborhood function and show that an embedded
closed totally geodesic hypersurface in a hyperbolic manifold has a tubular
neighborhood whose width only depends on the area of the hypersurface (and
hence not on the geometry of the ambient manifold). The implications of this
result for volumes of hyperbolic manifolds is discussed. We also derive a
(hyperbolic) quantitative version of the Klein-Maskit combination theorem (in
all dimensions) for free products of fuchsian groups. Using this last theorem,
we construct examples to illustrate the qualitative sharpness of the tubular
neighborhood function.
