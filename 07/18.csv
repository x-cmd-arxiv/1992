chiral gauge theories. At the leading order of a fermionic hopping parameter
expansion we find that the fermion-gauge coupling has a chiral and tree-like
structure. We argue that this fermion-gauge coupling remains non-zero in the
continuum limit taken in the Higgs phase. Possible fermion-scalar couplings in
this approach are considered. We also evaluate the fermion interaction with an
external gauge field in the slightly modified model and show that it has a
chiral structure in general.
