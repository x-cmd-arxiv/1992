symmetric NGT system. The structure of the vacuum field equations is analyzed
and the exact solutions for the field variables in the metric tensor are found
in the form of expansions in powers of a radial coordinate. We find that in the
NGT axially symmetric case the mass of the system remains constant only if the
system is static (as it necessarily is in the case of spherical symmetry). If
the system radiates, then the mass decreases monotonically and the energy flux
associated with waves is positive.

preserves the canonical measure rather than $\delta(H-E)$. We apply this
inexact dynamics to the 2D XY model, comparing to various implementations of
hybrid Monte Carlo, focusing on critical exponents and critical slowing down.
In addition, we discuss a scheme for making energy non-conserving dynamical
algorithms exact without the use of a Metropolis hit.

if the relics constitute our galactic halo and their branching ratios into
electron-positrons, photons and neutrinos are comparable, neutrino searches
would probe the longest lifetimes for masses $\simge 40 \TeV$, while
electron-positron searches would be better but more uncertain for lighter
particles. If instead the relics are not clustered in our halo, neutrinos are
more sensitive a probe than $\gamma$-rays for masses $\simge 700 \GeV$. A $ 1

simplify the calculation of loop amplitudes. This is achieved by using the
Feynman-parameter representation where the offending off-shell loop momenta do
not appear. Background Feynman gauge also helps to simplify the calculations.
This method is applicable to any Feynman diagram with any number of loops as
long as the external masses can be ignored, and it is at least as efficient as
the string technique in the special circumstances when the latter can be used.
In order to minimize the very considerable algebra encountered in non-abelian
gauge theories, graphical methods are developed for most of the calculations.
This enables the large number of terms encountered to be organized visually in
the Feynman diagram without the necessity of having to write down any of them
algebraically. A one-loop four-gluon amplitude in a particular helicity
configuration is computed explicity to illustrate the method.

on $CP^3$, which appears as the coset of the complexified conformal group
modulo its maximal parabolic subgroup. In this language one visualizes the
twistor correspondence of Penrose and Ward and consistently formulates the
