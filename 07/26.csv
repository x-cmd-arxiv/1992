is calculated numerically using the relation between phase shift and energy
levels of two-particle states recently derived by L\""{u}scher. The results
agree with the prediction of perturbation theory. A practical difficulty of the
method for a reliable extraction of the phase shift for large momenta due to
the necessity of a precise determination of excited two-particle energy levels
is pointed out.

groups by stressing at all stages the connection with the classical case ($q
\rightarrow 1$ limit). The Lie derivative and the contraction operator on forms
and tensor fields are found. A new, explicit form of the Cartan--Maurer
equations is presented. The example of a bicovariant differential calculus on
the quantum group $GL_q(2)$ is given in detail. The softening of a quantum
group is considered, and we introduce $q$-curvatures satisfying q-Bianchi
identities, a basic ingredient for the construction of $q$-gravity and
$q$-gauge theories.

general two dimensional conformal field theory are studied. They are expressed
in terms of beta functions for renormalization of general couplings under local
change of scale. The beta functions for homogeneous background are given
perturbatively in terms of the data of the original conformal theory without
any specific assumptions on its nature. The renormalization of couplings to
primary operators and to first descendents is considered as well as that of
couplings of a dilatonic type which involve explicit dependence on world sheet
curvature.
