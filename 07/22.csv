methods have been proposed. The first starts from a first order lagrangian
formulation, the second from a hamiltonian formulation. In this note we show
that they lead to identical results for the specific cases of pure gravity with

model within the recently introduced multicanonical ensemble. Replica on
lattices of size $L^2$ up to $L=48$ are investigated. Once a true groundstate
is found, we are able to give a lower bound on the number of statistically
independent groundstates sampled. Temperature dependence of the energy, entropy
and other quantities of interest are easily calculable. In particular we report
the groundstate results. Computations involving the spin glass order parameter
are more tedious. Our data indicate that the large $L$ increase of the
ergodicity time is reduced to an approximately $V^3$ power law. Altogether the
results suggest that the multicanonical ensemble improves the situation of
simulations for spin glasses and other systems which have to cope with similar
problems of conflicting constraints.

subspaces of a real or complex Banach space with increasing dimensions can be
``refined'' to yield an F.D.D. (G_n), still having increasing dimensions, so
that either every bounded sequence (x_n), with x_n in G_n for n in N, is weakly
null, or every normalized sequence (x_n), with x_n in G_n for n in N, is
equivalent to the unit vector basis of l_1.
  Crucial to the proof are two stabilization results concerning Lipschitz
functions on finite dimensional normed spaces. These results also lead to other
applications. We show, for example, that every infinite dimensional Banach
space X contains an F.D.D. (F_n), with lim_{n to infty} dim (F_n)=infty, so
that all normalized sequences (x_n), with x_n in F_n, n in N, have the same
spreading model over X. This spreading model must necessarily be
