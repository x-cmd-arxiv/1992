  Theory and Phi^4 Field Theory","26 pages, UCD-92-17",,,,"hep-lat",,"  For a system near a second order phase transition, the probability
distribution for the order parameter can be given a finite size scaling form.
This fact is used to compare the finite temperature phase transition for the
Wilson lines in d=3+1 SU(2) lattice gauge theory with the phase transition in
d=3 phi^4 field theory. I exhibit the finite size scaled probability
distributions in the form of a function of two variables (the reduced
`temperature' and the magnetization) for both models. The two surfaces look
identical, and an analysis of the errors also suggests that they are the same.
This strengthens the idea that the SU(2) effective line theory is in the Ising
universality class. I argue for the wider application of the method used here.

However, the corresponding production rates can be weaker than in the standard

the Higgs boson mass limits derived from LEP1. More strikingly, the main Higgs
decay channel is ""invisible"", over most of the mass range accessible to LEP1,
leading to events with large missing energy carried by majorons. This
possibility should be taken into account in the planning of Higgs boson search
strategies not only at LEP but also at high energy supercolliders.

a description by a semi classical Lorentz metric must contain either a naked
singularity or what we call a thunderbolt, a singularity that spreads out to
infinity on a spacelike or null path. We investigate this question in the
context of various two dimensional models that have been proposed. We find that
if the semi classical equations have an extra symmetry that make them solvable
in closed form, they seem to predict naked singularities but numerical
calculations indicate that more general semi classical equations, such as the
original CGHS ones give rise to thunderbolts. We therefore expect that the semi
classical approximation in four dimensions will lead to thunderbolts. We
interpret the prediction of thunderbolts as indicating that the semi classical
approximation breaks down at the end point of black hole evaporation, and we
would expect that a full quantum treatment would replace the thunderbolt with a
burst of high energy particles. The energy in such a burst would be too small
to account for the observed gamma ray bursts.
