planar surface, by ballistic, straight-line trajectory transport, and assuming
irreversible adhesion on contact with the surface or previously deposited
particles. Our data indicate that the deposit formed has a loosely layered
structure within few diameters from the surface. This structure can be
explained by a model of growth via chain formation. Away from the surface we
found evidence of a monotonic, power-law approach to the bulk density. Both
density and contact-statistics results suggest that the deposit formed is
sparse: the space-filling fraction is about 15%, and the average number of
contacts is 2. The morphology of the deposit both near the surface and in the
bulk seems to be a result of competition of screening and branching; nearly
half of all the spheres are either single-contact dangling ends, or branching
nodes with more than two contacts.

supersymmetry and a worldsheet reparametrisation supergroup. It contains only a
finite set of auxiliary fields. The key ingredient are the commuting spinor
(twistor) variables, which naturally arise as worldsheet superpartners of the
target space Grassmann coordinates. These spinors parametrise the sphere $S^8$
regarded as a coset space of the $D=10$ Lorentz group. The sphere is associated
with the lightlike vector of one of the string Virasoro constraints. The origin
of the on-shell $D=10$ fermionic kappa symmetry of the standard Green-Schwarz
formulation is explained. An essential and unusual feature is the appearance of
the string tension only on shell as an integration constant.

electrically charged elementary string excitations. We also discuss the
possibility that the duality symmetry is an exact symmetry of the full string

exchanged with magnetically charged soliton like solutions. This proposal might
be made concrete following the suggestion of Dabholkar et. al. that fundamental
strings may be regarded as soliton like classical solutions in the effective

operator is found in the special case of a spacetime in which the total deficit

eigenfunctions. The resultant interacting quantum field theory is not unitary
because the field operators can create real, on-shell, particles in the acausal
region. These particles propagate for finite proper time accumulating an
arbitrary phase before being annihilated at the same spacetime point as that at
which they were created. As a result, the effective potential within the
acausal region is complex, and probability is not conserved. The stress tensor
of the scalar field is evaluated in the neighborhood of the Cauchy horizon; in
the case of a sufficiently small Compton wavelength of the field, the stress
tensor is regular and cannot prevent the formation of the Cauchy horizon.
