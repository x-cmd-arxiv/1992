associated with a first order phase transition at a critical time $t_c$,
generates a large increase in the speed of light and a superluminary
communication of information occurs, allowing all regions in the Universe to be
causally connected. This solves the horizon problem, leads to a mechanism of
monopole suppression in cosmology and can resolve the flatness problem. After
the critical time $t_c$, local Lorentz (and diffeomorphism) invariance is
restored and light travels at its presently measured speed. The kinematical and
dynamical aspects of the generation of quantum fluctuations in the
superluminary Universe are investigated. A scale invariant prediction for the
fluctuation density amplitude is obtained.

turns out that squark and slepton masses tend to be much larger than gaugino
masses. Furthermore, we show that these soft breaking terms can be perfectly
consistent with both experimental and naturalness constraints (the latter comes
from the absence of fine tuning in the $SU(2)\times U(1)_Y\rightarrow
U(1)_{em}$ breaking process). This is certainly non--trivial and in fact
imposes interesting constraints on measurable quantities. More precisely, we
find that the gluino mass ($M_3$) and the chargino mass ($M_{\chi^{\pm}}$)
cannot be much higher than their present experimental lower bounds
($M_3\stackrel{<}{{}_\sim}285\ $GeV ; $M_{\chi^\pm}\stackrel{<}{{}_\sim}80\
