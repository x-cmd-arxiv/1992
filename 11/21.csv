result of the reaction $p\bar p\to\chi^\pm_1\chi^0_2X$, where $\chi^\pm_1$ is
the lightest chargino and $\chi^0_2$ is the next-to-lightest neutralino. This
signal is expected to have very little background and is the best prospect for
supersymmetry detection at Fermilab if the gluino and squarks are beyond reach.
We evaluate our expressions for all points in the allowed parameter space of
two basic supergravity models: (i) the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model
including the severe constraints from proton decay and a not too young
Universe, and (ii) a recently proposed no-scale flipped $SU(5)$ supergravity
model. We study the plausible experimental scenaria and conclude that a large
portion of the parameter spaces of these models could be explored with
$100\ipb$ of integrated luminosity. In the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model
chargino masses up to $90-95\GeV$ could be probed. In the no-scale flipped
model it should be possible to probe some regions of parameter space with
$m_{\chi^\pm_1}\lsim200\GeV$, therefore possibly doubling the reach of LEPII
for chargino and neutralino (since $m_{\chi^0_2}\approx m_{\chi^\pm_1}$)
masses. In both models such probes would indirectly explore gluino masses much
beyond the reach of Fermilab.

the conceptual universe of physics with appropriate perspective. There is a
certain irony in the achievements of QCD. For the problems which initially
drove its development only limited insight has been achieved. However I shall
argue that QCD is actually {\it more\/} special and important a theory than one
had any right to anticipate. After elaborating these quasi-philosophical
remarks, I discuss two current frontiers of physics that illustrate the
continuing vitality of the ideas. The recent wealth of beautiful precision
experiments measuring the parameters of the standard model has made it possible
to consider the unification of couplings in unprecedented quantitative detail.
One central result emerging from these developments is a tantalizing hint of
virtual supersymmetry. The possibility of phase transitions in matter at
temperatures of order $\sim 10^2 Mev$, governed by QCD dynamics, is of interest
from several points of view. There is the interesting possibility of long-range
correlations in heavy ion collisions due to the creation of large regions of
misaligned chiral condensate. Opening Talk at the Aachen conference, ``20 Years
