three dimensions. From this, we calculate the spectral dimension $d_s$ and the
walk dimension $d_w$ and test the scaling relation $d_s = 2d_f/d_w$ ($=2d/d_w$
for an Eden tree). Finite-size induced crossovers are observed, whereby the
system crosses over from a short-time regime where this relation is violated
(particularly in two dimensions) to a long-time regime where the behavior
appears to be complicated and dependent on dimension even qualitatively.

subalgebra A of a Banach algebra B. We show that if A is strongly spectral
invariant in a C*-algebra B, and G is a compactly generated polynomial growth
Type R Lie group, not necessarily connected, then the smooth crossed product
G\rtimes A is spectral invariant in the C*-crossed product G\rtimes B. Examples
of such groups are given by finitely generated polynomial growth discrete
groups, compact or connected nilpotent Lie groups, the group of Euclidean
motions on the plane, the Mautner group, or any closed subgroup of one of
these. Our theorem gives the spectral invariance of G\rtimes A if A is the set
of C^{\infty}-vectors for the action of G on B, or if B= C_{0}(M), and A is a
set of G-differentiable Schwartz functions S(M) on M. This gives many examples
of spectral invariant dense subalgebras for the C*-algebras associated with
dynamical systems. We also obtain relevant results about exact sequences,
subalgebras, tensoring by smooth compact operators, and strong spectral
invariance in L_{1}(G, B).

$N$ steps is of order $3^{N/4}$ times a polynomial in $N$, and so the approach
is greatly superior to direct counting techniques. We have enumerated walks of
up to 39 steps. As a consequence, we are able to accurately estimate the
critical point, critical exponent, and critical amplitude.

are introduced so that all the physical fermion fields possess shift symmetry
when the Yukawa coupling vanishes. With the fermionic hopping parameter
expansion it is shown that the fermion mass is proportional to the Higgs vacuum
expectation value and that the coupling of fermion to the external gauge field
can be chiral if the hopping parameter of the scalar regulator field is taken
to the critical value.
