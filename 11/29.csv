Anal. 112 (1993) p.31-60",,,"funct-an math.OA",,"  Voiculescu's random matrix model for freeness is extended to the non-Gaussian
case and also the case of constant block diagonal matrices. Thus we are able to
investigate free products of free group factors with matrix algebras and with
the hyperfinite II$_1$ factor, showing that $$ L(F_n) * R = L(F_(n+1)) $$ for
$n \ge 1$, (where $L(F_1)=L(Z)$).

proofs of their properties with respect to compression by projections and
taking free products are proved. Hence it follows that all the free group
factor are isomorphic to each other or none of them are. These factors were
defined and these properties were proved independently by F. Radulescu, and
those given in this paper are equivalent, but use different techniques.
Specifically, we develop algebraic techniques that allow us to show that R*R =
L(F_2), where R is the hyperfinite II_1 factor.

algebras is examined, and the result is determined to be the direct sum of a
finite dimensional algebra and an interpolated free group factor $L(\freeF_r)$.
The finite dimensional part depends on the minimal projections of the original
algebras and the ""dimension"", r, of the free group factor part is found using
the notion of free dimension. For discrete amenable groups $G$ and $H$ this
implies that the group von Neumann algebra $L(G*H)$ is an interpolated free
group factor and depends only on the orders of $G$ and $H$.

  Kontsevich model--different approach","LaTeX, 8p",,,,"hep-th",,"  The technique of $Q$-polinomials are used to derive the $w$- constraints in
the two-matrix and Kontsevich-like model at finite $N$. These constraints are
closed and form Lie algebra. They are associated with the matrices, $\lambda
^n{\partial}_\lambda^m$ with $n,m\geq 0$. In the case of two-matrix model they
can be reduced to the $W$-constraints of \cite{8}. For the case of
Kontsevich-like model and two-matrix model with the finite polinomial
potential, the number of constraints are limited by the power of the finite
matrix potential i.e. the spin of $w$-s coincide with that power. This
statement is the natural consequence of the form of constraints.

new interest also in O(N) vector models. The limit $N \rightarrow \infty$,
correlated with the limit $g \rightarrow g_c$, results in an expansion in terms
of filamentary surfaces and explicit calculations can be carried out also in
dimensions $d\geq 2$. It is shown here that the absence of physical massless
bound states in two dimensions sets strong constraints on this limit.
