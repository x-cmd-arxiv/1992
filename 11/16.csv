slowing down in simulations of vertex models. Since the clusters are closed
paths of bonds, we call it the {\em loop algorithm}. The basic steps in
constructing a cluster are the break-up and the freezing of vertices. We
concentrate on the case of the F model, which is a subset of the 6-vertex model
exhibiting a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The loop algorithm is also
applicable to simulations of other vertex models and of one and two-dimensional
quantum spin systems.

simulation data. Within the theory the origin of self-organized critical
phenomena is analysed in terms of a nonlinear singularity spectrum different
from the typical convex shape due to multifractal measures.

naturally in the description of many physical systems. Typically one encounters
such systems in a regime of low tension but high stiffness against bending,
which is just the opposite of the regime described by the Polyakov string. We
study a class of couplings between membrane shape and in-plane order which
break 3-space parity invariance. Remarkably there is only {\it one} such
allowed coupling (up to boundary terms); this term will be present for any
lipid bilayer composed of tilted chiral molecules. We calculate the
renormalization-group behavior of this relevant coupling in a simplified model
and show how thermal fluctuations effectively reduce it in the infrared.

5.74,~6.0 and 6.26 covering sizes from about 0.7~$fm$ to 2~$fm$. We confirm
that beyond 1.5~$fm$ the volume dependence is negligible. By carefully
analysing results obtained using different trial wave functions for the heavy
meson we find no dependence on the smearing. We also give results for the mass
difference of the scalar - pseudoscalar and the $\Lambda _{b}$ - pseudoscalar.
Using the mass of the pseudoscalar meson we estimate the distance of string
breaking in the static quark potential.

calculate the form factors for semileptonic decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons into
light pseudoscalars and light vector resonances. The available data, together
with some additional assumptions, allow for a set of predictions in the
different semileptonic channels, which can be compared with those following
{}from different approaches. A discussion of non-dominant terms in our

have to wait till more abundant data become available.

Depending on the values of the masses, however, both scenarios or none could
