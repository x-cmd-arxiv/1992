  Approximation to Many-Bubble Collisions","In plain TeX, 28 pages (not including 13 figures, available by

produced by the collision of true-vacuum bubbles that is simple enough to allow
the simulation of a phase transition by the collision of hundreds of bubbles.
This ``envelope approximation'' neglects the complicated ``overlap'' regions of
colliding bubbles and follows only the evolution of the bubble walls. The
approximation accurately reproduces previous results for the gravitational
radiation from the collision of two scalar-field vacuum bubbles. Using a bubble
nucleation rate given by $\Gamma = \Gamma_0 e^{\beta t}$, we simulate a phase
transition by colliding 20 to 200 bubbles; the fraction of vacuum energy
released into gravity waves is $E_{\rm GW}/E_{\rm vac} = 0.06(H/\beta)^2$ and
the peak of the spectrum occurs at $\omega_{\rm max}=1.6\beta$ ($H^2=8\pi G\rho
/3$ is the Hubble constant associated with the false-vacuum phase). The
spectrum is very similar to that in the two-bubble case, except that the
efficiency of gravity-wave generation is about five times higher, presumably
due to the fact that a given bubble collides with many others. Finally, we
consider two further ``statistical'' approximations, where the gravitational
radiation is computed as an incoherent sum over individual bubbles weighted by
the distribution of bubble sizes. These approximations provide reasonable
estimates of the gravitational-wave spectrum with far less computation.

supergravity model under experimental test. Using the two-loop gauge coupling
renormalization group equations, with the inclusion of supersymmetric threshold
corrections, we calculate a new value for the proton decay rate in this model
and find that SuperKamiokande and Gran Sasso should see the proton decay mode
$p\to\bar\nu K^+$ for most of the allowed parameter space. A set of physically
sensible assumptions and the cosmological requirement of a not too young
Universe give us a rather restrictive set of allowed points in the parameter
space, which characterizes this model. This set implies the existence of
interesting correlations among various masses: either the lightest chargino and
the next-to-lightest neutralino are below $\approx100\GeV$ (and therefore
observable at the Tevatron) or the lightest Higgs boson is below
$\approx50\GeV$ (and therefore observable at LEP I-II). These tests are crucial
steps towards selecting the correct low-energy effective supergravity model. We
also comment on the compatibility of the model with $\sin^2\theta_w(M_Z)$
measurements as a function of $\alpha_3(M_Z)$.
