luminosity--limited sample of ellipticals and bulges of S0s and spirals of the
Virgo and Fornax clusters. This finding, based on {\it ad hoc\/} new
observations, is confirmed by a much larger set of literature data for
$\sim1500$ galaxies. The {\it `ordinary'\/} family is biparametric: $L_T\propto
I_e\,R_e^2$; its members are fainter that $M_B\simeq-19.3$ and smaller than
$\re\simeq3$ kpc (whatever $M_B$ is). The {\it 'bright'\/} family is
uniparametric ($\mu_e$ depends on $R_e$ alone) and hosts brightest cluster
members and QSO parent galaxies. We show that the segregation in the ($\log
R_e, \mu_e$) plane has an important counterpart in the behavior of various
physical parameters, which is markedly different for galaxies smaller ({\it
`ordinary'\/} family) and larger ({\it 'bright'\/} family) than $R_e=3$ kpc.

skyrmion mass according to the semi-classical expansion theory of solitons. We
claim that this contribution can be accurately estimated despite the fact that
some of the counterterms, provided in principle by chiral perturbation theory,
are not known in practice. Using $\zeta$ function techniques we show that
$E_{cas}=E_{cas}(\mu)+E_{ct}(\mu)$ where $E_{cas}(\mu)>>E_{ct}(\mu)$ because it
incorporates all the zero-mode contributions and it can be exactly calculated.
Our results confirm that the fourth order Skyrme lagrangian does not seem to
provide a correct description of the lightest baryons as solitons. We show that
a simple extension to order six gives, on the contrary, good results without
tuning the parameters of the chiral lagrangian.

manifold fluctuating in d-dimensional Euclidean space, interacting with a
single impurity via an attractive or repulsive delta-potential (but without
self-avoidance interactions). Except for D=1 (the polymer case), this model
cannot be mapped onto a local field theory. We show that the use of intrinsic
distance geometry allows for a rigorous construction of the high-temperature
perturbative expansion and for analytic continuation in the manifold dimension
D. We study the renormalization properties of the model for 0<D<2, and show
that for d<d* where d*=2D/(2-D) is the upper critical dimension, the
perturbative expansion is UV finite, while UV divergences occur as poles at
d=d*. The standard proof of perturbative renormalizability for local field
theories (the BPH theorem) does not apply to this model. We prove perturbative
renormalizability to all orders by constructing a subtraction operator based on
a generalization of the Zimmermann forests formalism, and which makes the
theory finite at d=d*. This subtraction operation corresponds to a
renormalization of the coupling constant of the model (strength of the
interaction with the impurity). The existence of a Wilson function, of an
epsilon-expansion around the critical dimension, of scaling laws for d<d* in
the repulsive case, and of non-trivial critical exponents of the delocalization
transition for d>d* in the attractive case is thus established. To our
knowledge, this provides the first proof of renormalizability for a model of
extended objects, and should be applicable to the study of self-avoidance
interactions for random manifolds.
