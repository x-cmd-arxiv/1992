de Blois, June 15-20, 1992, was a meeting well-timed for a reconsideration of
the issues in particle astrophysics in the light of the COBE discovery of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. This is a summary of what I
thought were the most interesting things discussed at Blois: (1) The
near-success of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in predicting the COBE fluctuation
amplitude, which favors the hypothesis that structure formed in the universe
through gravitational collapse. (2) The indications that $\Omega\approx1$ and
that the power spectrum has a little more power on supercluster and larger
scales than CDM. These are suggested by the IRAS and CfA redshift surveys and
POTENT galaxy peculiar velocity analysis, and also by the COBE data. (3) The
consequent demise of CDM and the rise of hybrid schemes such as Cold+Hot Dark
Matter (C+HDM). (4) The possible implications for neutrino masses and mixings,
and for cosmology, of the recent results on solar neutrinos. (5) The first
discovery of TeV $\gamma$ rays from an extragalactic source, which was
announced at Blois. I also summarize here a number of the exciting ongoing and
planned experiments and observations discussed at Blois: CERN experiments on
$\nu_\mu \nu_\tau$ oscillations, which may be sufficiently sensitive to detect
the $\nu_\tau$ if

orbital radius. Assuming that a laser interferometric gravitational observatory
can track the gravitational-wave frequency (twice the orbital frequency) as it
sweeps through its sensitive bandwidth between about 10 Hz and one kHz, we
estimate the accuracy with which the spins of the component bodies can be
determined from the gravitational-wave signal.

high precision estimates of the critical coupling $K_c$, Binder's parameter
$U^* and the critical exponents $\nu,\beta / \nu, \eta$, and $\alpha / \nu$,
using extensively histogram reweighting and optimization techniques that allow
us to keep control over the statistical errors. Measurements of the
autocorrelation time show the expected reduction of critical slowing down at
the phase transition as compared to local update algorithms. This allows
simulations on significantly larger lattices than in previous studies and
consequently a better control over systematic errors in finite-size scaling
analyses.

briefly three of the themes that I stressed at the Neutrino '92 Conference: 1)
Different solar model codes give the same answers when the same input data are
used; 2) Improved calculations of standard solar models include helium
diffusion, the Livermore radiative opacity, the meteoritic iron abundance, and
a variety of other corrections; and 3) There are a few basic rules that should
be followed in using standard solar models. At the Neutrino '92 Conference, I
reviewed in more detail the recent work on standard solar models by Marc
Pinsonneault and myself. This work has by now appeared in print (Rev. Mod.
Phys. 64, 885, 1992, hereafter Paper I, and ApJ Letters, 69, 717, 1992, Paper
II). Therefore, there is no need for me to repeat the details here.

  Model with an Additional Singlet","14, PURD-TH-92-11",,,,"hep-ph",,"  An upperbound on the mass of the lightest neutral scalar Higgs boson is
calculated in an extended version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model
that contains an additional Higgs singlet. We integrate the renormalization
group equations of the model, and impose low energy boundary conditions
consistent with present experimental results, and ultra-violet conditions
following from triviality. Radiative corrections induced by a large top quark
Yukawa coupling are included in our analysis, and we find the allowed values
for the mass of the Higgs boson as a function of the mass of the top quark.
Typically, for a top quark mass $m_t=150\ GeV$, the upper bound on the Higgs
boson mass is about $25 \ GeV$ higher than in the minimal model.

effective action is regularized using Schwinger's proper time method. Numerical
results for the static soliton energy are presented for the cases without and
with vector and axialvector fields. It is found that the baryon number is
carried by the polarized Dirac sea of the quarks if the $a_1$ meson is included
in contrast to the case without $a_1$ where the baryon number resides on
valence quarks. Thus the model strongly supports the picture of the baryon as a
topological soliton of the meson fields. Including the $\omega $ vector meson
leads to a non--vanishing imaginary part of the Euclidian effective action even
for static solitons. Leaving the chiral circle, i.e.\ including the isoscalar
scalar meson, the soliton first seems unstable. However, we demonstrate that a
$\phi ^4$ term stabilizes the soliton. Finally, the self--consistent
two--flavor chiral soliton is embedded in the SU(3) flavor group and
collectively quantized. The predicted mass splittings for the low--lying
baryons with different hypercharge are in excellent agreement with the
experimental data if the physical value for the kaon decay constant is
substituted.

of the axial singlet matrix element (relevant to the ""proton spin"" puzzle) in a
generalized Skyrme model of pseudoscalars and vectors. These two calculations
are, perhaps surprisingly, linked to each other and furthermore are sensitive
to some fine details of symmetry breaking in the effective meson Lagrangian.
This provides a motivation for us to examine these symmetry breaking terms more
closely. We find a qualitatively new feature in the symmetry breaking pattern
of the vector meson system and discuss its significance. (Talk at Workshop on
""Baryons as Skyrme Solitons,"" Sept. 28-30, 1992, Siegen, Germany.)
