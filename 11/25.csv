distribution of sub-critical bubbles of the unstable phase by examining three
possible mechanisms responsible for their removal; their shrinking, their
coupling to thermal noise, and by thermal fluctuations of the true vacuum
inside them. We show that for sufficiently strong transitions, either the
shrinking or the coupling to thermal noise dominate the dynamics. As the
strength of the transition weakens we show that sub-critical fluctuations
become progressively more important, as a larger fraction of the total volume

shown, using a quantum version of the generalized Miura transformation, that

of symplectic diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle of the space-time. Gauge
transformations for $W$-gravity gauge fields are given by requiring the
invariance of a generalised line element. Densities exist and can be
constructed from the line element (generalising $\sqrt { \det g_{\mu \nu}}$)
only if $d=1$ or $d=2$, so that only for $d=1,2$ can actions be constructed.
