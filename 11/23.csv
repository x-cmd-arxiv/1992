dynamics (MD) simulations of granular particles. In our model, to break
contacts between two particles, one has to apply a finite amount of force,
determined by the Coulomb criterion. Using a two dimensional model, we show
that piles generated by avalanches have a {\it finite} angle of repose
$\theta_R$ (finite slopes). Furthermore, these piles are stable under tilting
by an angle smaller than a non-zero tilting angle $\theta_T$, showing that
$\theta_R$ is different from the angle of marginal stability $\theta_{MS}$,
which is the maximum angle of stable piles. These measured angles are compared
to a theoretical approximation. We also measure $\theta_{MS}$ by continuously
adding particles on the top of a stable pile.

  Pimsner-Voiculescu Exact Sequence","38 pages, TeX format",,,,"funct-an math.OA",,"  We introduce a method to study C*-algebras possessing an action of the circle
group, from the point of view of its internal structure and its K-theory. Under
relatively mild conditions our structure Theorem shows that any C*-algebra,
where an action of the circle is given, arises as the result of a construction
that generalizes crossed products by the group of integers.
  Such a generalized crossed product construction is carried out for any
partial automorphism of a C*-algebra, where by a partial automorphism we mean
an isomorphism between two ideals of the given algebra.
  Our second main result is an extension to crossed products by partial
automorphisms, of the celebrated Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence for
K-groups.
  The representation theory of the algebra arising from our construction is
shown to parallel the representation theory for C*-dynamical systems. In
particular, we generalize several of the main results relating to regular and
covariant representations of crossed products.

self-adjoint operators in terms of the eigenvalue distributions of their n x n
sections. Under rather general circumstances, we show how these eigenvalues
accumulate near points of the essential spectrum of the given operator, and we
prove that their averages converge to a measure concentrated precisely on the
essential spectrum.
  In the primary cases of interest, namely the discretized Hamiltonians of
one-dimensional quantum systems, this limiting measure is associated with a
tracial state on a certain simple C*-algebra. These results have led us to
conclude that one must view this kind of numerical analysis in the context of
C*-algebras.

fermion determinants. This is for example the case for the $\rm U(1)_L \otimes
U(1)_R$ symmetric Yukawa model with mirror fermions, if the number of
generations of fermions and mirror fermions is odd. Whether a numerical
simulation of such a model is possible depends on the magnitude of fluctuations
of the complex phase factor of the fermion determinant. We investigate the
fermion determinant of the U(1) Yukawa model with mirror fermions for a
physically relevant choice of parameters. The argument of the complex phase
turns out to fluctuate only very little and is at most of the order of $2 \cdot
10^{-3}$.

in the Skyrme model, we report about the properties of a single skyrmion on a
compact 3-sphere of finite radius. The density of this matter can be increased
by decreasing the hypersphere radius. As in the array calculations one
encounters a transition to a distinct high density phase characterized by a
delocalization in energy and baryon charge and by increased symmetries. We will
argue that the high density phase has to be interpreted as chirally restored
one. The arguments are based on the formation of complete chiral multiplets and
the vanishing of the pionic massless Goldstone modes in the high-density
fluctuation spectrum. We show that the restoration of chiral symmetry is common
to any chirally invariant extension of the usual Skyrme model - whether via
higher-order contact terms or via the introduction of stabilizing vector mesons
which act over a finite range. (Talk at the workshop on ``Baryons as Skyrme
