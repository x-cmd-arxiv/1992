creation of an opaque pair plasma fireball, just like in cosmological sources.
We find that the typical physical conditions in a galactic halo fireball are:
optical depth $\ap 10^8$, thermal energy $\ap 100 KeV$, maximal relativstic
expansion $\G \ap 300 $ and a maximal baryonic load of $\ap 10^{-15} M_\odot$.
This does not rule out galctic halo models but it poses an addtional severe
constraint on all such sources. A comparison of these conditions with the
physical conditions at cosmological fireballs reveal that galactic halo
fireballs are less favorable than cosmological ones as sources of gamma ray
bursts.

familiar. Usually, as in the Brans-Dicke theory or in string theory, these are
conformally related Riemannian geometries. Is this the most general relation
between the two geometries allowed by physics ? We study this question by
supposing that the physical geometry on which matter dynamics take place could
be Finslerian rather than just Riemannian. An appeal to the weak equivalence
principle and causality then leads us the conclusion that the Finsler geometry
has to reduce to a Riemann geometry whose metric - the physical metric - is
related to the gravitational metric by a generalization of the conformal
transformation.

the particles without an internal structure may utilize one representation of
the Lorentz group, phenomenologies of composite particles may exploit a
different representation. As such (perhaps, only some of) the meson structures
beyond the standard $q\,\overline {Q}$ may exploit the $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$
generalized canonical representation of the Lorentz group -- this would result
in a meson and the associated antimeson to manifest themselves in {\it

  \end{document} (and available upon request)",,,"UM-TH 92--30","hep-ph",,"  A new class of flavor changing (FC) neutral interactions can arise in models
based on extended gauge groups (rank $>$4) when new charged fermions are
present together with new neutral gauge bosons. In some cases the FC couplings
to a new $Z_1$ are expected to be sizeable, implying that the $Z_1$ mass must
be large enough as to explain the observed suppression of FC transitions.
Concentrating on E$_6$ models and assuming for the FC parameters a
theoretically natural range of values, I show that in most cases the presence
of a $Z_1$ much lighter than 1 TeV is unlikely.

signature target space metric having a covariantly constant null Killing
vector. These models are UV finite. The $2+N$-dimensional target space metric
can be explicitly determined for a class of supersymmetric sigma models with
$N$-dimensional `transverse' part of the target space being homogeneous
K\""ahler. The corresponding `transverse' sub-theory is an $n=2$ supersymmetric
sigma model with the exact $\gb$-function coinciding with its one-loop
expression. For example, the finite $D=4$ model has $O(3)$ supersymmetric sigma
model as its `transverse' part. Moreover, there exists a non-trivial dilaton
field such that the Weyl invariance conditions are also satisfied, i.e. the
resulting models correspond to string vacua. Generic solutions are represented
in terms of the RG flow in `transverse' theory. We suggest a possible
application of the constructed Weyl invariant sigma models to quantisation of
$2d$ gravity. They may be interpreted as `effective actions' of the quantum
$2d$ dilaton gravity coupled to a (non-conformal) $N$-dimensional `matter'
theory. The conformal factor of the $2d$ metric and $2d$ `dilaton' are
identified with the light cone coordinates of the $2+N$ - dimensional sigma
model.
