SU(2) Yang-Mills. The problem of contamination by flux states is discussed, and
a new analysis method described. The large size of the tensor glueball is
confirmed. Preliminary results in the deconfined phase show no significant
changes.

satisfying Dirichlet conditions (Dirichlet strings) in $D=4$ is shown to have
logarithmic dependence on energy, in addition to the power-like behavior known
before. High temperature free energy also depends logarithmically on
temperature. Such a result could provide a matching mechanism between strings
at long distance and asymptotic freedom at short distance, which is necessary
for the reformulation of large-$N$ QCD as a string theory.

W-algebra of gauge invariant differential polynomials.

to a set of conformal fields as a toy model for quantum cosmology. We discuss
the cosmological solutions of the model and study the effect of including the
backreaction due to quantum corrections. As a result, when the matter density
is below some threshold new singularities form in a weak coupling region, which
suggests that they will not be removed in the full quantum theory. We also
solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Depending on the quantum state of the
Universe, the singularities may appear in a quantum region where the wave
function is not oscillatory, i.e., when there is not a well defined notion of
classical spacetime.

Lebedev inst. preprint, FIAN/TD/18-92","hep-th",,"  A generalized version is proposed for the field-antifield formalism. The
antibracket operation is defined in arbitrary field-antifield coordinates. The
antisymplectic definitions are given for first- and second-class constraints.
In the case of second-class constraints the Dirac's antibracket operation is
defined. The quantum master equation as well as the hypergauge fixing procedure
are formulated in a coordinate-invariant way. The general hypergauge functions
are shown to be antisymplectic first-class constraints whose Jacobian matrix
determinant is constant on the constraint surface. The BRST-type generalized
transformations are defined and the functional integral is shown to be
independent of the hypergauge variations admitted. In the case of reduced phase
space the Dirac's antibrackets are used instead of the ordinary ones.
