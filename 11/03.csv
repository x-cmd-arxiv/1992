correlated tau-spins at LEP does not constitute a test of local realistic
theories via Bell's inequality. The central point of the argument is that such
tests, where the spins of two particles are inferred from a scattering
distribution, can always be described by a local hidden variable theory. In
response to questions at the workshop we go beyond the paper and show that an
old experiment involving the measurement of the correlated spins of the two
photons emitted in positronium decay via Compton-scattering is also not a
viable test of Bell's inequality.

  When generalizing a characterization of centre-by-finite groups due to B. H.

with vert G / Z(G) vert = kappa but [G:N_G(U)] < kappa for all (abelian)
subgroups U of G, where kappa is an uncountable cardinal. We consider this
question for kappa = omega_1 and kappa = omega_2. It turns out that the answer
is largely independent of ZFC, and that it differs greatly in the two cases.
  More explicitly, for kappa = omega_1, it is consistent with, and independent
of, ZFC that there is a group G with vert G / Z(G) vert = omega_1 and [G:N_G
(A)] leq omega for all abelian A leq G. We do not know whether the same
statement is still consistent if we drop abelian. On the other hand, for kappa

[G : N_G (A) ] leq omega_1 for all (abelian) A leq G is equiconsistent with the
existence of an inaccessible cardinal. In particular, there is an extraspecial
