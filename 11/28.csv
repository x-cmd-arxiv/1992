Frechet algebras to be m-convex.) Let G be a Lie group, not necessarily con-
nected, which acts on both $A$ and B by *-automorphisms, and let \s be a sub-
multiplicative function from G to the nonnegative real numbers. If \s and the
action of G on A satisfy certain simple properties, we define a dense Frechet
*-subalgebra G\rtimes^{\s} A of the crossed product L^{1}(G, B). Our algebra
consists of differentiable A-valued functions on G, rapidly vanishing in \s.
  We give conditions on the action of G on A which imply the m-convexity of the
dense subalgebra G\rtimes^{\s}A. A locally convex algebra is said to be m-con-
vex if there is a family of submultiplicative seminorms for the topology of the
algebra. The property of m-convexity is important for a Frechet algebra, and is
useful in modern operator theory.
  If G acts as a transformation group on a manifold M, we develop a class of
dense subalgebras for the crossed product L^{1}(G, C_{0}(M)), where C_{0}(M)
denotes the continuous functions on M vanishing at infinity with the sup norm
topology.We define Schwartz functions S(M) on M, which are differentiable with
respect to some group action on M, and are rapidly vanishing with respect to
some scale on M. We then form a dense m-convex Frechet *-subalgebra G\rtimes^
{\s} S(M) of rapidly vanishing, G-differentiable functions from G to S(M).
  If the reciprocal of \s is in L^{p}(G) for some p, we prove that our group
algebras S^{\s}(G) are nuclear Frechet spaces, and that G\rtimes^{\s}A is the
projective completion S^{\s}(G) \otimes A.

\Delta\rho parameters have been calculated at one loop. It is shown that the
continuum values for these quantities can be reproduced without requiring
explicit fine tuning of counterterms. Furthermore, fermion fields doubling is
not necessary. To the best of our knowledge, the Zaragoza proposal is the only
scheme which has these properties. A necessary (although not sufficient)
symmetry is found to support the calculations. Previous results for some of
these parameters in other lattice chiral regularizations are revisited in the
light of this symmetry.

only provide MSW neutrino mixing suitable for solving the solar neutrino

$0(10)eV$ as indicated by recent COBE results, but can also naturally account
for the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Heavy singlet neutrino decay
generates a net lepton asymmetry which is subsequently reprocessed by
nonperturbative electroweak interactions. We evaluate the baryon asymmetry so
produced in light of the constraints that the COBE observations put on
inflationary cosmologies, finding it comfortably consistent with observation.

for the enlarged rational conformal field theories in both series of W-algebras

two generators which includes the spin three algebra at $c=-2$ also has
finitely many additional fields in the twisted sector although the model itself
is apparently not rational. The additional fields in the twisted sector have
applications in statistical mechanics as we demonstrate for $Z_n$-quantum spin
chains with a particular type of boundary conditions.
