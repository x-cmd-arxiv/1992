nature form a chain from the world of the subatomic particles to the large
bodies of the universe, the galaxies. Then, it proposes a new baryonic force
for the universe that is the fifth force which has been proposed in the
literature. It explains the universal expansion itself and shows why the
expansion must be slowing down at present. This force depends on the ratio of
the number of neutrons to the number of protons. Its potential for the Universe
is a well. At the bottom of the well the potential is of the form $kx^2$, where
$x$ is the separation among the bodies under consideration. It is suggested
that Nature has six fundamental forces which are unified in pairs and,
therefore, reduced to three at $t=0$. The condition for having a closed
universe is found. This new force, called superweak force in this paper,
explains also the evolution of galaxies and shows how the arms of spiral
galaxies(including barred spirals) are formed. The variation of the Hubble
constant with time is shown. It is shown that quarks are formed of prequarks
which may be the true elementary particles. The paper also gives a physical
explanation for quark confinement. The energies of baryon states are calculated
in a simple manner. The paper proposes the existence of four more bosons, one
for the superweak interaction and three for the superstrong interaction. The
six figures will be sent by mail upon request.

demonstrating the Goldstone nature of the pion in the chiral limit. Our results
agree qualitatively and quantitatively with expectations both from current

interesting toy model of the black hole dynamics. The functional measures are
explicitly evaluated and the physical state conditions corresponding to the
Hamiltonian and the momentum constraints are derived. It is pointed out that
the constraints form the Virasoro algebra without central charge. In ADM
formalism the measures are very ambiguous, but in our formalism they are
explicitly defined. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM formalism
come out. A singularity appears at $\df^2 =\kappa (>0) $, where $\kappa
=(N-51/2)/12 $ and $ N$ is the number of matter fields. Behind the singularity
the quantum mechanical region $\kappa > \df^2 >0 $ extends, where the sign of
the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian constraint changes. If $\kappa <0 $, the
singularity disappears. We discuss the quantum dynamics of black hole and then
give a suggestion for the resolution of the information loss paradox. We also
argue the quantization of the spherically symmetric gravitational system in 3+1
dimensions. In appendix the differences between the other quantum dilaton
gravities and ours are clarified and our status is stressed.
