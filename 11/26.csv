operator which commutes with all (first-class) constraints, including the
super-Hamiltonian. The problem of the frozen formalism is to explain how
dynamics is possible when all observables are constants of the motion. An
explicit model of a measurement-interaction in a parametrized Hamiltonian
system is used to elucidate the relationship between three definitions of
observables---as something one observes, as self-adjoint operators, and as
operators which commute with all of the constraints. There is no inconsistency
in the frozen formalism when the measurement process is properly understood.
The projection operator description of measurement is criticized as an
over-idealization which treats measurement as instantaneous and
non-destructive. A more careful description of measurement necessarily involves
interactions of non-vanishing duration. This is a first step towards a more
even-handed treatment of space and time in quantum mechanics. (This paper was
written for the festschrift of Dieter Brill.)

bounce solutions. In this paper I derive a modified formalism to deal with such
cases. As in the usual case, the bubble nucleation rate may be written in the
form $A e^{-B}$. To leading approximation, $B$ is the bounce action obtained by
replacing the tree-level potential by the leading one-loop approximation to the
effective potential, in agreement with the generally adopted {\it ad hoc}
remedy. The next correction to $B$ (which is proportional to an inverse power
of a small coupling) is given in terms of the next-to-leading term in the
effective potential and the leading correction to the two-derivative term in
the effective action. The corrections beyond these (which may be included in
the prefactor) do not have simple expressions in terms of the effective
potential and the other functions in the effective action. In particular, the
scalar-loop terms which give an imaginary part to the effective potential do
not explicitly appear; the corresponding effects are included in a functional
determinant which gives a manifestly real result for the nucleation rate.

supergravity. We show that in the minimal case, namely when the special
geometry prepotential F(X) is a quadratic polynomial, the theory has a so far
unknown on shell U(1) symmetry, that we name R-duality. R-duality is a
generalization of the chiral-dual on shell symmetry of N=2 pure supergravity
and of the R-symmetry of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory. Thanks to this, the
theory can be topologically twisted and topologically shifted, precisely as
pure N=2 supergravity, to yield a natural coupling of topological gravity to
topological Yang-Mills theory. The gauge-fixing condition that emerges from the
twisting is the self- duality condition on the gauge field-stength and on the
spin connection. Hence our theory reduces to intersection theory in the
moduli-space of gauge instantons living in gravitational instanton backgrounds.
We remark that the topological Yang-Mills theory we obtain by taking the flat
space limit of our gravity coupled Lagrangian is different from the Donaldson
theory constructed by Witten. Whether this difference is substantial and what
its geometrical implications may be is yet to be seen. We also discuss the
topological twist of the hypermultiplets leading to topological quaternionic
$\sigma$-models. The instantons of these models, named by us hyperinstantons,
correspond to a notion of triholomorphic mappings discussed in the paper.
