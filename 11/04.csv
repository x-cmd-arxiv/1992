ground state configurations of the Kagom\'{e}-lattice quantum Heisenberg
antiferromagnet is \mbox{studied}. The cluster consists of the six spins on a
hexagon of the lattice. The resulting tunnel splitting energy $\Delta$ is
calculated in detail, including the prefactor to the exponential $\exp(- \SSo /
\hbar)$. This is done by setting up a coherent spin state path integral in
imaginary time and evaluating it by the method of steepest descent. The hexagon
tunneling problem is mapped onto a much simpler tunneling problem, involving
only one collective degree of freedom, which can be treated by known methods.
It is found that for half-odd-integer spins, the tunneling amplitude and the
tunnel splitting energy are exactly zero, because of destructive interference
between symmetry-related $(+)$-instanton and $(-)$-instanton tunneling paths.
This destructive interference is shown to occur also for certain larger loops
of spins on the Kagom\'{e} lattice. For small, integer spins, our results
suggest that tunneling strongly competes with \mbox{in-plane}
order-from-disorder selection effects; it constitutes a disordering mechanism
that might drive the system into a partially disordered ground state, related
to a spin nematic.
