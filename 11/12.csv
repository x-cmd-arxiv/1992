mass pole $M_\gamma$. I show this is not true. Indeed, in the Villain
approximation the monopole part of the partition function factorizes from the
photon part, whose dynamical variables are Dirac strings. Since Dirac strings
are gauge-variant structures, I conclude that $M_\gamma$ is physically
irrelevant: it is not a blood relative of $\lambda$ or any other quantity in
the gauge-invariant sector. This result is confirmed by numerical simulations
in the full theory, where $M_\gamma$ is not sensitive to monopole prohibition
but essentially vanishes if Dirac strings are prohibited.

analogous to those needed for the chiral perturbation theory program with only
pseudoscalars. An improved description of the $\eta-\eta^\prime$ system is also

investigate some aspects of baryon physics which are especially sensitive to
symmetry breaking. For this purpose a fairly elaborate ``cranking"" techinque is
employed in connection with the collective Hamiltonian. In addition to the
``strong"" baryon mass spectrum a careful investigation is made of the
non-electromagnetic part of the neutron-proton mass difference. This work is

widths at future $\phi$ factories. The understanding of these meson structures
is valuable not only in hadron spectroscopy but also in nuclear physics in
