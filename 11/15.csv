  relativity?","LATEX 37 pages, no figures",,,,"gr-qc",,"  I attempt to answer the question of the title by giving an annotated list of
the major results achieved, over the last six years, in the program to
construct quantum general relativity using the Ashtekar variables and the loop
representation. A summary of the key open problems is also included. Also
included are expositions of several new results including the construction of
spatially diffeomorphism invariant observables constructed by coupling general
relativity to matter fields.

B401 (1993) 206-238","10.1016/0550-3213(93)90303-7",,"hep-th",,"  In this paper, we present a new formulation of topological conformal gravity
in four dimensions. Such a theory was first considered by Witten as a possible
gravitational counterpart of topological Yang-Mills theory, but several
problems left it incomplete. The key in our approach is to realise a theory
which describes deformations of conformally self-dual gravitational instantons.
We first identify the appropriate elliptic complex which does precisely this.
By applying the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, we calculate the number of
independent deformations of a given gravitational instanton which preserve its
self-duality. We then quantise topological conformal gravity by BRST
gauge-fixing, and discover how the quantum theory is naturally described by the
above complex. Indeed, it is a process which closely parallels that of the
Yang-Mills theory, and we show how the partition function generates an uncanny
gravitational analogue of the first Donaldson invariant.

From the mean field point of view, it is equivalent to the Kazakov-Migdal
induced gauge theory and therefore, at $N=\infty$ and $d>1$, the latter can be
interpreted as a matrix model for infinite-tension strings. We show that, in
the naive continuum limit, it is governed by the one-matrix-model saddle point
with an upside-down potential. To derive mean field equations, we consider the
one-matrix model in external field. As a simple application, its explicit
solution in the case of the inverted W potential is given.
