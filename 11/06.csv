background violate the classical energy conditions near the black hole.
Nevertheless, the associated equilibrium thermodynamical entropy $\Delta S$ by
which such fields augment the usual black hole entropy is found to be positive.
More precisely, the derivative of $\Delta S$ with respect to radius, at fixed
black hole mass, is found to vanish at the horizon for {\it all} regular
renormalized stress-energy quantum tensors. For the cases of conformal scalar
fields and U(1) gauge fields, the corresponding second derivative is positive,
indicating that $\Delta S$ has a local minimum there. Explicit calculation
shows that indeed $\Delta S$ increases monotonically for increasing radius and
is positive. (The same conclusions hold for a massless spin 1/2 field, but the
accuracy of the stress-energy tensor we employ has not been confirmed, in
contrast to the scalar and vector cases). None of these results would hold if
the back-reaction of the radiation on the spacetime geometry were ignored;
consequently, one must regard $\Delta S$ as arising from both the radiation
fields and their effects on the gravitational field. The back-reaction, no

make a significant contribution to tests of the Standard Model at the level of

features of nuclear structure, such as the spatial distribution of neutrons in
the nucleus. To examine the sensitivity to nuclear structure, we consider the
case of Pb isotopes using various recent relativistic and non-relativistic
nuclear model calculations. Contributions from nucleon internal weak structure
are included, but found to be fairly negligible. The spread among present
models in predicted sizes of nuclear structure effects may preclude using Pb
isotope ratios to test the Standard Model at better than a one percent level,
unless there are adequate independent tests of the nuclear models by various
alternative strong and electroweak nuclear probes. On the other hand,
sufficiently accurate atomic PNC experiments would provide a unique method to
measure neutron distributions in heavy nuclei.
