flowing radial null dust which is homogeneous in the black hole interior. In
the region $r^2 \ll e^2$ we find an approximate analytic solution to the
classical field equations. The renormalized stress-energy tensor is evaluated
on this background and we find the vacuum polarisation backreaction corrections
to the mass function $m(r)$. Asymptotic analysis of the semiclassical mass
function shows that the mass inflation singularity is much stronger in the
presence of vacuum polarisation than in the classical case.

that small color singlet clusters are unimportant in the thermal ensemble. We
also find that at T = 0.75 T_c the induced quark number shows a surprisingly
large component attributable to baryonic screening. A simulation of a simple
flux tube model produces results that suggest a plausible scenario: As the
crossover temperature is approached from below, baryonic states proliferate.
Above the crossover temperature the mean size of color singlet clusters grows
explosively, resulting in an effective electrostatic deconfinement.

calculation of the mean field of a kink-type configuration. Using this
equivalence it is found that all the $1 \to n$ amplitudes have no absorptive
part at the thresholds to any order of perturbation theory. This implies
non-trivial relations between multi-boson threshold production amplitudes. In
particular the on-mass-shell amplitude of the process $2 \to 3$ should vanish
at the threshold in all loops. It is also shown that the factor $n!$ in the $1

part of the metric. The infrared dynamics of the conformal factor is generated
by an effective action, induced by the trace anomaly of matter in curved space,
analogous to the Polyakov action in two dimensions. The resulting effective
scalar theory is renormalizable, and possesses a non-trivial, infrared stable
fixed point, characterized by an anomalous scaling dimension of the conformal
factor. We argue that this theory describes a large distance scale invariant
phase of 4D gravity and provides a framework for a dynamical solution of the
cosmological constant problem.
