the effect of the slight heating of neutrinos by $e^\pm$ annihilations. There
is a small, systematic change in the $^4$He yield, $\Delta Y \simeq +1.5\times
10^{-4}$, which is insensitive to the value of the baryon-to-photon ratio
$\eta$ for $10^{-10}\la \eta \la 10^{-9}$. We also find that the
baryon-to-photon ratio decreases by about 0.5\% less than the canonical factor
of 4/11 because some of the entropy in $e^\pm$ pairs is transferred to
neutrinos. These results are in accord with recent analytical estimates.

gauge theory techniques. The formulation permits a calculation of heavy quark
processes even when the momentum transfers are much larger than the inverse
lattice spacing. Applications include semi-leptonic heavy quark decay and
scattering processes, including the computation of the nonperturbative part of
the Isgur-Wise universal function.

$K\dual$ be its polar body. We present an elementary proof of the fact that
$$(\Vol K)(\Vol K\dual)\ge \frac{b_n^2}{(\log_2 n)^n},$$ where $b_n$ is the
volume of the Euclidean ball of radius 1. The inequality is asymptotically
weaker than the estimate of Bourgain and Milman, which replaces the $\log_2 n$
by a constant. However, there is no known elementary proof of the
Bourgain-Milman theorem.
