of Pisarski's method for resumming hard thermal loops. Braaten and Pisarski
have used the Ward identities satisfied by the hard corrections to the n-point
functions to argue the gauge fixing independence of the leading order resummed
QCD plasma damping rate in covariant and strict Coulomb gauges. We extend their
analysis to include all linear gauges that preserve rotational invariance and
display explicitly the conditions required for gauge fixing independence. It is
shown that in covariant gauges the resummed damping constant is gauge fixing
independent only if an infrared regulator is explicitly maintained throughout
the calculation.

momentum is used together with the finite temperature renormalization group to
study the temperature dependence of the mass and the coupling to one-loop order
in the $(\phi^3)_6$- and $(\phi^4)_4$-models. It is found that the critical
temperature is shifted relative to the naive one-loop result and the coupling
constants at the critical temperature get large corrections. In the high
temperature limit of the $\phiff$-model the coupling decreases.

the conformal mode is explicitly separated. The dynamics of the conformal mode
is understood in terms of the oversubtraction due to the one loop counter term.
The renormalization of the gravitational dressed operators is studied and their
anomalous dimensions are computed. The exact scaling exponents of the 2
dimensional quantum gravity are reproduced in the strong coupling regime when
we take $\epsilon\rightarrow0$ limit. The theory possesses the ultraviolet
fixed point as long as the central charge $c<25$, which separates weak and
strong coupling phases. The weak coupling phase may represent the same
universality class with our Universe in the sense that it contains massless
gravitons if we extrapolate $\epsilon$ up to 2.
