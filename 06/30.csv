broken phase using the standard and a Symanzik improved action with infinite
bare self-coupling $\lambda$. A high precision Monte Carlo simulation is
performed by applying the reflection cluster algorithm. Employing the histogram
method we analytically continue to a sequence of values of the hopping
parameter $\kappa$ neighbouring the actually simulated ones. In the
investigated vicinity of the critical point $\kappa_{c}$ finite volume effects
affecting, e.g., the determination of the field expectation value $\Sigma$ and
the mass $m_\sigma$ of the $\sigma$-particle are very well described by 1-loop
renormalized perturbation theory. We carry out a detailed scaling analysis on a
high level of precision. Finally we discuss the upper bound on the Higgs mass
for both kinds of actions.

that the gauge orbit space with gauge potentials and gauge tranformations
restricted on the space boundary in non-abelian gauge theories with a $\theta$
term has a magnetic monopole structure if there is a magnetic monopole in the
ordinary space. The Dirac's quantization condition in the corresponding quantum
theories ensures that the vacuum angle $\theta$ in the gauge theories must be
quantized. The quantization rule is derived as $\theta=2\pi/n~(n\neq 0)$ with n
being the topological charge of the magnetic monopole. Therefore, we conclude
that the strong CP problem is automatically solved non-perturbatively with the
existence of a magnetic monopole of charge $\pm 1$ with $\theta=\pm 2\pi$. This
is also true when the total magnetic charge of monopoles are very large
($|n|\geq 10^92\pi$) if it is consistent with the abundance of magnetic
monopoles. This implies that the fact that the strong CP violation can be only
so small or vanishing may be a signal for the existence of magnetic monopoles.

coset-space construction in which the divisor group is generated by the
non-negative modes of the Virasoro algebra, with subsequent application of an
infinite set of covariant constraints. The initial doubly-infinite set of
Goldstone fields arising in this construction is reduced by the covariant
constraints to a singly-infinite set corresponding to the Cartan-subalgebra
generators $v^\ell_{-(\ell+1)}$. We derive the transformation rules of this
surviving set of fields, finding a triangular structure in which fields
transform into themselves or into lower members of the set only. This
triangular structure gives rise to finite-component subrealisations, including
the standard one for a single scalar. We derive the Maurer-Cartan form and
