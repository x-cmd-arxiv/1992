parameter and contrast it with the effect of QCD-like technicolor dynamics. Our
main tools are the operator product expansion for the high-momentum behavior of
the electroweak gauge boson vacuum polarizations and the analyticity of these
polarizations which relate their low and high momentum behaviors. We show that
whereas in large QCD-like technicolor models $S$ is large and positive, in
walking technicolor models a negative contribution is emphasized, related to
the large anomalous dimension of the technifermion condensate. Thus in walking
technicolor $S$ is determined by a large cancellation of two competing effects.
This may result in much smaller values of $S$ than in QCD-like technicolor,
although considerable uncertainties are involved. We conclude that it is
impossible to rule out walking technicolor based on the present experimental
limits on $S$ and the present theoretical technology.

all-loop resummations of the most important infrared contributions. In this
paper we perform, as a first step towards a full analysis of the Standard Model
case, a detailed study of the effective potential of the scalar theory. We show
that subleading corrections to the self-energies lead to spurious terms, linear
in the field-dependent mass $m(\phi)$, in the daisy-improved effective
potential. Consistency at subleading order requires the introduction of
superdaisy diagrams, which prevent the appearance of linear terms. The
resulting $V_{eff}(\phi,T)$ for the scalar theory hints at a phase transition
which is either second-order or very weakly first-order.

Secondly, we examine a conjectured connection to branched polymers, but find
that the scaling solutions of the unitary models do not agree with those of a
particular model describing branched polymers.
