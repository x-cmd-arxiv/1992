high temperature quantum chromodynamics. In a high statistics numerical
simulation using a Swendson-Wang algorithm, we study cubic lattices of
dimension as large as $64^3$ and measure correlation functions on long lattices
of dimension $20^2\times 120$ and $30^2\times 120$. These correlations are
controlled by the spectrum of the transfer matrix. This spectrum is studied in
the vicinity of the phase transition. The analysis classifies the spectral
levels according to an underlying $S_3$ symmetry. Near the phase transition the
spectrum agrees nicely with a simple four-component hamiltonian model. In the
context of this model, we find that low temperature ordered-ordered interfaces
nearly always involve a disordered phase intermediate. We present a new
spectral method for determining the surface tension between phases.

in strongly coupled quenched QED. Interpreted as a model of technicolor having
strong interactions at short distances, we predict the techni-meson mass

Our results support the strict inequality that the techni-sigma mass $M_\sigma$
is less than twice the dynamical quark mass $M_f$, and confirm that the
techni-pion is a Nambu-Goldstone boson. The level ordering $0 = M_\pi <
M_\sigma < 2M_f < M_\rho < M_{a1} $ is found.An equation of state, and scaling
laws are derived for the techni-meson masses by exploiting correlation length
scaling. The resulting universality relations are confirmed by simulations on
$16^4$, $32\times 16^3$ and $32^4$ lattices. The anomalous dimension $\eta$ is
measured to be approximatively $0.50$ in good agreement with past lattice
simulations and hyperscaling relations, as well as with the analytic solution
of the quenched, planar gauged Nambu-Jona Lasinio model solved by continuum
Schwinger-Dyson equation techniques.

for the two pion decays $\dtwo\to\dstar\pi\pi$, $\done\to\dstar\pi\pi$ and
$\done\to\d\pi\pi$, which are dominated by pole graphs. Our predictions depend

\Gamma(\done\to\dstar\pi\pi):\Gamma(\done\to\d\pi\pi)=3:1:2$, but this relation

lepton number is violated explicitly by charged scalar and gauge bosons,

  Although there exist in the literature several models based on a
$SU(3)\otimes U(1)$ gauge symmetry, our model has a different representation
content and a quite different new physics at an, in principle, arbitrary mass
scale.
  This is possibly the simplest way to enlarge the gauge group $SU_L(2)\otimes
U_Y(1)$ in order to have doubly charged gauge bosons, without losing the
natural features of the standard electroweak model. The price we must pay is
the introduction of exotic quarks, with electric charge $5/3$ and $-4/3$.
  A previous version of the model was considered several months ago concerning
the possibility that in this kind of models neutrinoless double beta decay
proceeds even for massless neutrinos and with scalar exchange instead of vector
exchange.

"hep-ph/9206245","Greg Anderson","Greg W. Anderson","Remarks on the Electroweak Phase Transition","11",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In the standard scenario, the electroweak phase transition is a first order
phase transition which completes by the nucleation of critical bubbles.
Recently, there has been speculation that the standard picture of the
electroweak phase transition is incorrect. Instead, it has been proposed that
throughout the phase transition appreciable amounts of both broken and unbroken
phases of $SU(2)$ coexist in equilibrium. I argue that this can not be the
case. General principles insure that the universe will remain in a homogenous
state of unbroken $SU(2)$ until the onset of critical bubble production.
  In addition, an analytic treatment of the one Higgs doublet, electroweak
phase transition in the standard model and minimal extensions is reviewed.
Results from the thin wall approximation are compared to results obtained using
the Lindes' action. Perhaps the most important quantitative result we can get
from an analysis of the phase transition is determination of $\vevphi$ when the
phase transition completes. For Higgs boson masses above the current
experimental limit, the thin wall approximation determines the value of
$\vevphi$ at the end of the phase transition to an accuracy of better than
three percent.
