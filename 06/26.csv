quantum field theories with arbitrary smoothly curved boundaries is described.
It is based on an expansion of the heat kernel derived earlier for arbitrary
mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
  The method is applied to a general renormalisable scalar field theory in four
dimensions using dimensional regularisation to two loops and expanding about
arbitrary background fields. Detailed results are also specialised to an $O(n)$
symmetric model with a single coupling constant. Extra boundary terms are
introduced into the action which give rise to either Dirichlet or generalised
Neumann boundary conditions for the quantum fields. For plane boundaries the
resulting renormalisation group functions are in accord with earlier results
but here the additional terms depending on the extrinsic curvature of the
boundary are found. Various consistency relations are also checked and the
implications of conformal invariance at the critical point where the $\beta$
function vanishes are also derived. The local Scr\""odinger equation for the
wave functional defined by the functional integral under deformations of the
boundary is also verified to two loops. Its consistency with the
renormalisation group to all orders in perturbation theory is discussed.

simulations of the $2D$ and $3D$ Ising model. Following Binder we extract the
interfacial free energy from the infinite volume limit of the magnetic

reproducing with high precision exact $2D$ results. In the physically more
interesting $3D$ case we estimate the amplitude $F^s_0$ of the critical
interfacial tension $F^s = F^s_0 t^\mu$ to be $F^s_0 = 1.52 \pm 0.05$. This
result is in good agreement with a previous MC calculation by Mon, as well as
with experimental results for related amplitude ratios. In addition, we study
in some details the shape of the magnetic probability density for temperatures
below the Curie point.

fermion pairs. The presence of these heavy fermions affects the elastic
scattering of $W$'s by propagating in loops, greatly reducing the amplitudes in
some charge channels. Consequently, the symmetry--breaking sector cannot be
fully explored by using, for example, the $W^+W^+$ mode alone; all $WW

renormalization group analysis is performed to separate fermion self-mass into
a dynamical and a kinematical part. It is shown that the energy scale og the
Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation and the effective gauge coupling are fixed by the
current mass. The dynamical self-mass satisfies a homogeneous SD equation which
has a trivial solution when the current mass exceeds a critical value. We
therefore suggest that the quark condensate, as the function of the current
mass, observes a local minimum around 2.7\Lambda_(QCD).

one-loop amplitudes are finite at non-coincident external points, but do not

systematic procedure to obtain one-loop renormalized amplitudes with finite
Fourier transforms in strictly four dimensions without the appearance of
integrals or the use of a regulator. Higher loops are solved similarly by
renormalizing from the inner singularities outwards to the global one. We
compute all 1- and 2-loop 1PI diagrams, run renormalization group equations on
them and check Ward identities. The method furthermore allows us to discern a
particular pattern of renormalization under which certain amplitudes are seen
not to contain higher-loop leading logarithms. We finally present the
computation of the chiral triangle showing that differential renormalization
emerges as a natural scheme to tackle $\gamma_5$ problems.
