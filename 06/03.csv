three symmetric punctures is investigated. We study deformation aspects between
two point and three point differentials as well as the behaviour of the
corresponding Krichever-Novikov algebras. The structure constants are
calculated and from this we derive a central extension of the Krichever-Novikov
algebras by means of b-c systems. The defining cocycle for this central
extension deforms to the well known Virasoro cocycle for certain kinds of
degenerations of the torus.

Heisenberg-Ising spin 1/2 chain is studied for a ring geometry threaded by
magnetic flux. We find that for charged fermions having interaction strength
$\Delta=\cos(\pi / p)$ with $p$ {\it noninteger}, the adiabatic ground state is
periodic in the magnetic flux threading the chain, with period 2 flux quanta,
as found by Shastry and Sutherland for the repulsive case. We find that, at
particular values of the threading field, a sequence of initially zero-energy
bound states form at the Fermi surface during the adiabatic process, the
largest containing $[p]$ (the integer part of $p$) fermions. This largest bound
state moves around to the other Fermi point and sequentially unbinds. We find
Berry's Phase for the whole process to be $[p] \pi$. For $p$ {\it integer}, as
$\Phi$ increases, eventually all the particles in the system go into bound
states of size $[p]$. The period in this case is of order the size of the
system.

field develops the vacuum average, the fluctuations of which describe the
elementary excitations of our gauge theory. At $N= \infty $ we find two phases
of the model, with asymptotic freedom corresponding to the strong coupling
phase (if there are no phase transitions at some critical $N$). We could not
solve the model in this phase, but in the weak coupling phase we have derived
exact nonlinear integral equations for the vacuum average and for the scalar
excitation spectrum. Presumably the strong coupling equations can be derived by
the same method.
