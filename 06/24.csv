to the decay amplitudes, which results in a large uncertainty in the value of

pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixing angles is examined, focusing the
attention on orbifold constructions, where the magnitude of Yukawa couplings
depends on the values of the deformation parameters which describe the size and
shape of the compactified space. A systematic exploration shows that for $Z_3$,
$Z_4$, $Z_6$--I and possibly $Z_7$ orbifolds a correct fit of the physical
fermion masses is feasible. In this way the experimental masses, which are
low--energy quantities, select a particular size and shape of the compactified
space, which turns out to be very reasonable (in particular the modulus $T$
defining the former is $T=O(1)$). The rest of the $Z_N$ orbifolds are rather
hopeless and should be discarded on the assumption of a minimal $SU(3)\times
SU(2)\times U(1)_Y$ scenario. On the other hand, due to stringy selection
rules, there is no possibility of fitting the Kobayashi--Maskawa parameters at
the renormalizable level, although it is remarked that this job might well be
done by non--renormalizable couplings.

detail. The action is defined by elementary vertices satisfying recursion
relations that give rise to Jacobi-like identities for an infinite chain of
string field products. The genus zero string field algebra is the homotopy Lie
algebra $L_\infty$, and the higher genus algebraic structure implies the
Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) master equation. From these structures on the off-shell
state space, we show how to derive the $L_\infty$ algebra, and the BV equation
on physical states, recently constructed in d=2 string theory. The string
diagrams are surfaces with minimal area metrics, foliated by closed geodesics
of length $2\pi$. These metrics generalize quadratic differentials in that
foliation bands can cross. The string vertices are succinctly characterized;
they include the surfaces whose foliation bands are all of height smaller than
$2\pi$.
