model, is investigated on the $C_{60}$ molecule and other fullerenes. The
connectivity of $C_{60}$ leads to an exotic classical ground state with
nontrivial topology. We argue that there is no phase transition in the Hubbard
model as a function of $U/t$, and thus the large $U$ solution is relevant for
the physical case of intermediate coupling. The system undergoes a first order
metamagnetic phase transition. We also consider the S=1/2 case using
perturbation theory. Experimental tests are suggested.

tetrahedron, which is a closed 12 site system. We find that the ground state
has many similarities to that of $C_{60}$. We study 2- and 4-spin correlations
in the classical ground state of the truncated tetrahedron and calculate the
same correlations in the exact S=1/2 ground state. We find that the classical
correlations survive for a range of bond strengths in the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian and that one can construct a good trial wavefunction based on the
classical ground state. This suggests that the correlations present in the
classical ground state of $C_{60}$ also survive in the exact ground state of
that system, for a range of bond strengths about the physically relevant $J_2
\approx J_1$. We calculate the momentum-space correlation function $S ( q )$,
which is measurable by neutron scattering, for both $C_{12}$ and $C_{60}$. We
also calculate correlations at finite temperature.

in the longitudinal $WW$ scattering process. They presented a model in which
the $W$'s couple to pseudo--Goldstone bosons, which may be difficult to detect
experimentally. Because of these inelastic channels, the $WW$ interactions do
not become strong in the TeV region. We demonstrate that, despite the reduced
$WW$ elastic amplitudes in this model, the total event rate ($\sim 5000$ extra
longitudinal $W^+W^-$ pairs produced in one standard SSC year) does not
decrease with an increasing number of inelastic channels, and is roughly the
same as in a model with a broad high--energy resonance and no inelastic
channels.

neutrino is specially affected by the non-linear effect of the heavy top quark
mass. The derived ratios have application to solar, atmospheric, and

partition function is computed by summing contributions from all possible
topologies. The behavior such a sum can be estimated in three spacetime
dimensions in the limit of small cosmological constant. The sum over topologies
diverges for either sign of $\Lambda$, but for dramatically different reasons:
for $\Lambda>0$, the divergent behavior comes from the contributions of very
low volume, topologically complex manifolds, while for $\Lambda<0$ it is a
consequence of the existence of infinite sequences of relatively high volume
manifolds with converging geometries. Possible implications for
four-dimensional quantum gravity are discussed.
