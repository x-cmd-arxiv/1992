"alg-geom/9206005","Valery Alexeev","Valery Alexeev","Two Two-dimensional Terminations","25 pages, 4 figures, LaTeX 2.09",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  Varieties with log terminal and log canonical singularities are considered in
the Minimal Model Program, see \cite{...} for introduction. In
\cite{shokurov:hyp} it was conjectured that many of the interesting sets,
associated with these varieties have something in common: they satisfy the
ascending chain condition, which means that every increasing chain of elements
terminates. Philosophically, this is the reason why two main hypotheses in the
Minimal Model Program: existence and termination of flips should be true and
are possible to prove.
  In this paper we prove that the following two sets satisfy the ascending
chain condition:
  1. The set of minimal log discrepancies for $K_X+B$ where $X$ is a surface
with log canonical singularities.
  2. The set of groups $(b_1,...b_s)$ such that there is a surface $X$ with log
canonical and numerically trivial $K_X+\sum b_jB_j$. The order on such groups
is defined in a natural way.

analysis performed on the same data. The value of $z = 2.13 \pm 0.01$ is
obtained, which is consistent with most recent estimates.

  Apologies to those who tried earlier",,,,"hep-ph",,"  It now seems plausible that the observed baryon asymmetry may have been
produced at the electroweak phase transition. We review the considerations
which lead to this conclusion, focusing on the obstacles to making reliable
estimates. These arise from incomplete knowledge of baryon-violating rates near
the phase transition, our limited understanding of the phase transition itself,
and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms which actually lead to an
asymmetry.

which plague relic particle scenarios for the endpoint of black hole
evaporation, may be absent when the relics are horned particles. Most of our
arguments are based on simple observations about the classical geometry of
extremal dilaton black holes, but at a crucial point we are forced to speculate
about classical solutions to string theory in which the infinite coupling
singularity of the extremal dilaton solution is shielded by a condensate of
massless modes propagating in its infinite horn. We use the nonsingular $c=1$
solution of (1+1) dimensional string theory as a crude model for the properties
of the condensate. We also present a brief discussion of more general relic
scenarios based on large relics of low mass.

Ashtekar Hamiltonian formulation for general relativity. These equations may be
written as dynamical equations for three divergence free vector fields on a
three dimensional surface in the spacetime. A simplified form of these
equations, describing metrics with a one Killing field symmetry are written
down, and it shown that a particular sector of these equations has a
Hamiltonian form where the Hamiltonian is an arbitrary function on a
two-surface. In particular, any element of the $w_\infty$ algebra may be chosen
as a the Hamiltonian. For a special choice of this Hamiltonian, an infinite set
of solutions of the self-duality equations are given. These solutions are
parametrized by elements of the $w_\infty$ algebra, which in turn leads to an
explicit form of four dimensional complex self-dual metrics that are in one to
one correspondence with elements of this algebra.
