expansion in numbers of derivatives. Each successive term is suppressed by
powers of a scale, $\Lambda_\chi$, which must be less than of order $4\pi
f/\sqrt{N}$ where $f$ is the Goldstone boson decay constant and $N$ is the
number of flavors. The chiral expansion therefore breaks down at or below $4
\pi f/\sqrt{N}$. We argue that the breakdown of the chiral expansion is
associated with the appearance of physical states other than Goldstone bosons.
Because of crossing symmetry, some ``isospin'' channels will deviate from their
low energy behavior well before they approach the scale at which their low
energy amplitudes would violate unitarity. We argue that the estimates of
``oblique'' corrections from technicolor obtained by scaling from QCD are
untrustworthy.

degrees of freedom, which can serve as a laboratory for multiparticle
production in a collision. There is a cubic coupling between modes without,
however, any problems associated with unstable ground states. The model is
amenable to precise numerical calculations of nonperturbative 1->N transition
amplitudes. On an ordinary workstation, time and memory limitations effectively
restrict N to be $\le\ 8,$ and we present results for this case. We find (1)
that there is reasonable period of time for which there is a constant rate for
the 1->8 transition; (2) at the end of the linear period, the eight particle
amplitude attains a maximum value $\aemax$ which is about $3-4$ orders of
magnitude larger than the comparable amplitude for excitation of the $N=8$
state in the anharmonic oscillator; (3) for values of the coupling in the
region where the Born approximation fails, the amplitude is much larger than
the naive estimates $A_8\simeq \exp{(-1/\g2)}\ $ or $\ \exp{(-8)};$ it is more
like $A_8\sim\exp{(-0.20/\g2)}.$

obtained by means of the extended forms that involve all the required ghosts
and antifields. The BV actions for the non-abelian $BF$ theories (in 4 and
higher dimensions) and the Chern-Simons theory are constructed by means of the
extended form method. An extension of the $BF$ theory in 4-dimensions to
include a ``cosmological term'' is also examined and the close connection with
the topological Yang-Mills theory is indicated.
