fermions from the lattice is shown to undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
addition, the fermions appear to be Dirac-like everywhere in the phase diagram
with no room for undoubled Weyl fermions. The phase diagram of a closely
related Higgs-Yukawa model is similar to that of the Smit--Swift model, which
also does not give rise to chiral fermions. These results cast serious doubts
on the original scenario for the emergence of chiral fermions.

scattering amplitudes of neutrinos in a CP symmetric medium (such as the early
universe) are zero, and the index of refraction of a propagating neutrino can
only arise from the expansion of gauge boson propagators, from radiative
corrections, and from new physics interactions. Motivated by nucleosynthesis
constraints on a possible sterile neutrino (suggested by the solar neutrino
deficit and a possible $17\ keV$ neutrino), we calculate the standard model
contributions to the neutrino index of refraction in the early universe,
focusing on the period when the temperature was of the order of a few $MeV$. We
find sizable radiative corrections to the tree level result obtained by the
expansion of the gauge boson propagator. For $\nu_e+e(\bar{e})\to
\nu_e+e(\bar{e})$ the leading log correction is about $+10\%$, while for
$\nu_e+\nu_e(\bar{\nu}_e)\to \nu_e+\nu_e(\bar{\nu}_e)$ the correction is about
$+20\%$. Depending on the family mixing (if any), effects from different family
scattering can be dominated by radiative corrections. The result for
$\nu+\gamma\to\nu+\gamma$ is zero at one-loop level, even if neutrinos are
massive. The cancellation of infrared divergence in a coherent process is also
discussed.

presence of vector particles with anomalous magnetic moment couplings to scalar
particles, induces an instability of the vacuum. (ii) A delicate interplay
between the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron makes, in
magnetic fields $B\ge 2\times 10^{14}$ T, the neutron stable and for fields
$B\ge 5\times 10^{14}$ T the proton becomes unstable to a decay into a neutron
via $\beta$ emission. (iii) In the unbroken chiral $\sigma$ model magnetic
fields would be screened out as in a superconductor. It is the explicit
breaking of chiral invariance that restores standard electrodynamics.

theory, especially on the relationship to symplectic geometry. One might think
that the classical Chern-Simons theory, which is topological and so has
vanishing hamiltonian, is completely trivial. However, this theory exhibits
interesting geometry that is usually absent from ordinary field theories. (The
same is true on the quantum level; topological quantum field theories exhibit
geometric properties not usually seen in ordinary quantum field theories, and
they lack analytic properties which are usually seen.) In this paper we
carefully develop this geometry. Of particular interest are the line bundles
with connection over the moduli space of flat connections on a 2-manifold. We
extend the usual theory to cover 2-manifolds with boundary. We carefully
develop ``gluing laws'' in all of our constructions, including the line bundle
with connection over moduli space. The corresponding quantum gluing laws are
fundamental. Part 1 covers connected and simply connected gauge groups; Part 2
will cover arbitrary compact Lie groups.

symmetry of area-preserving diffeomorphisms ($W$-infinity algebra).
Intuitively, this is a consequence of gauge invariance, which forces dynamics
to depend only on the flux. The infinity of generators of this symmetry act
within each Landau level, which is infinite-dimensional in the thermodynamical
limit. The incompressible ground states corresponding to completely filled
Landau levels (integer quantum Hall effect) are shown to be infinitely
symmetric, since they are annihilated by an infinite subset of generators. This
geometrical characterization of incompressibility also holds for fractional
fillings of the lowest level (simplest fractional Hall effect) in the presence
of Haldane's effective two-body interactions. Although these modify the
symmetry algebra, the corresponding incompressible ground states proposed by
Laughlin are again symmetric with respect to the modified infinite algebra.
