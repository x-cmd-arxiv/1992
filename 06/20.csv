(i.e. non-superconducting) cosmic strings and compare the results with the
sensitivity of current and proposed TeV and EeV telescopes. Our calculations
give only upper limits for the gamma ray flux, since the source of the photons,
jets from particle production at cusps, may be weakened by back reaction
effects. For the usual cosmic distribution of strings, the predicted bursts
from strings with the value of mass per unit length associated with galaxy
formation or light strings may just be detectable. A diffuse gamma ray
background from light strings may also be seen by the Fly's Eye detector at
above $7 \times 10^{10}$ GeV.

momentum transfer. At LHC and SSC energies, we find that a cutoff BFKL equation
leads one to expect a measurable perturbative component in traditionally soft
processes. We show that the total cross section could become as large as 175 mb
(122 mb) and the rho parameter 0.40 (0.25) at the SSC (LHC).

D47 (1993) 5018-5020","10.1103/PhysRevD.47.5018",,"hep-ph",,"  Barbieri and Hall have argued that threshold effects at the scale of
grand-unification wipe out predictions on the SUSY scale, M_S. Using triviality
arguments we give upper bounds on ultraheavy particles, while proton stability
gives lower bounds on the mass of the higgs color-triplet. We find no useful
lower bound on the $\Sigma$ supermultiplet, but if the strong coupling constant
is as large as recent experiments suggest, unification in the minimal SUSY
SU(5) model requires that the $Sigma$ masses be $\sim 10^{-7}M_V$ and that the
color octet and weak triplet be split in mass by a factor of $\sim$100.

of the $D=4$ string theory provided with an axion charge is studied in the
effective theory approach. The most general exact solution is constructed. It
is found that the Kalb-Ramond axion charge, present in the string topology
$R^{3} \times S^{1}$, produces nontrivial gravitational field configurations
which feature horizons. The corresponding ``no-hair'' theorems are proved which
stress uniqueness of black strings. Connection of the solutions with the gauged
WZWN sigma model constructions on the world sheet is discussed since they are
the only target spaces which hide their singularities behind horizons, and thus
obey the cosmic censorship conjecture.
