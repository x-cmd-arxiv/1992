(Alice strings). In a GUT where the unbroken gauge group contains charge
conjugation ($C$), such strings form when a phase transition renders $C$ a
discrete symmetry. They become boundaries of domain walls at a later,
$C$-breaking transition. These `Alice walls' are cosmologically harmless, but
can play an important role in baryogenesis. We present a three-generation toy
model with scalar baryons, where a quasi-static Alice wall (or a gas of such
walls) temporarily gives rise to net baryogenesis of uniform sign everywhere in
space. This becomes a permanent baryon excess if the wall shrinks away early
enough.
  We comment on the possible relevance of a similar mechanism to baryogenesis
in a realistic $\soten$ unification model, where
  Alice walls would form at the scale of left-right symmetry breaking.

though the interaction involved is between nearest neighbors. The latter
phenomenon is interpreted as a genuine quantum group effect with no
``classical"" analog. The discussion of conformal properties is given.

the vacuum, and we identify the elements in the dressing group which allow us
to built the $N$-soliton solutions from the vacuum solution. The dressed
$\tau$-functions can be computed in two different ways~: either using adjoint
actions in the affine Lie algebra $\hat {sl_2}$, and this gives the relation
with the B\""acklund transformations, or using the level one representations of
the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{sl_2}$, and this directly gives the formulae
for the $\tau$-functions in terms of vertex operators.

isomonodromy deformation problems, as well as further possible generalizations.
