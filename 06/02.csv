naturally on the projective space parametrizing curves of a given degree. In
this note we begin the study of the orbits of smooth curves under this action:
we construct a resolution of the closure of the orbit of a given curve, and we
use it to compute its degree. This turns out to depend only on the degree of
the curve, the order of its automorphism group, and on the number and type of
its flexes. This paper will appear on the Journal of Algebraic Geometry.

$\beta=6/g^2$ between 4.5 and 5.0. For $N_t=16$ and 32, hadron masses and
screening lengths are computed for a variety of valence quark masses. The
previously observed, strong, first-order transition for $N_t=4$, 6 and 8 is
seen, for $N_t=16$, to become a $\beta$-independent, zero-temperature
transition characterized by a factor of $\approx 3$ change in lattice scale.
This strong, first-order transition restores chiral symmetry, at least for
$N_t=4$, 6 and 8, producing a chirally symmetric, weak-coupling phase. However,
as $N_t$ increases to 16, the chiral symmetry properties of the weak-coupling
side of the zero-temperature transition are unclear and offer a hint of a
normal, finite-temperature, chiral symmetry breaking transition in the
weak-coupling phase.

method for computing the conformally exact metric and dilaton, to all orders in
the $1/k$ expansion, for any bosonic, heterotic, or type-II superstring model
based on a coset $G/H$. We prove the following relations: (i) For type-II
superstrings the conformally exact metric and dilaton are identical to those of
the non-supersymmetric {\it semi-classical} bosonic model except for an overall
renormalization of the metric obtained by $k\to k- g$. (ii) The exact
expressions for the heterotic superstring are derived from their exact bosonic
string counterparts by shifting the central extension $k\to 2k-h$ (but an
overall factor $(k-g)$ remains unshifted). (iii) The combination
$e^\Phi\sqrt{-G}$ is independent of $k$ and therefore can be computed in lowest
order perturbation theory as required by the correct formulation of a
conformally invariant path integral measure. The general formalism is applied
to the coset models $SO(d-1,2)_{-k}/SO(d-1,1)_{-k}$ that are relevant for
string theory on curved spacetime. Explicit expressions for the conformally
exact metric and dilaton for the cases $d=2,3,4$ are given. In the
semiclassical limit $(k\to \infty)$ our results agree with those obtained with
the Lagrangian method up to 1-loop in perturbation theory.
