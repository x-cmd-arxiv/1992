dimensions at non-zero chemical potential and temperature using the Hybrid
Monte Carlo algorithm. The number of fermion flavors is chosen large $(N_f=12)$
to compare with analytic results. A first order chiral symmetry restoring
transition is found at zero temperature with a critical chemical potential
$\mu_c$ in good agreement with the large $N_f$ calculations. The critical index
$\nu$ of the correlation length is measured in good agreement with analytic
calculations. The two dimensional phase diagram (chemical potential vs.
temperature) is mapped out quantitatively. Finite size effects on relatively
small lattices and non-zero fermion mass effects are seen to smooth out the
chiral transition dramatically.

"hep-ph/9206259","Andrei Linde","Andrei Linde","Progress in the Theory of the Electroweak Phase Transition","24 pages, LaTeX, SU-ITP-92-18",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Recent progress in the theory of the electroweak phase transition is
discussed. For the Higgs boson mass smaller than the masses of W and Z bosons,
the phase transition is of the first order. However, its strength is
approximately 2/3 times less than what follows from the one-loop approximation.
This rules out baryogenesis in the minimal version of the electroweak theory
with light Higgs bosons. The possibility of the strongly first order phase
transition in the theory with superheavy Higgs bosons is considered.
  We show that if the Yang-Mills field at high temperature acquires a magnetic
mass $\sim g^2 T$, then no linear terms appear in the effective potential in
all orders of perturbation theory and the symmetry in gauge theories at high
temperatures is actually restored. Even though the last statement was never
questioned by most of the authors, it was extremely difficult to come to a
reliable conclusion about it due to the infrared problem in thermodynamics of
non-Abelian gauge fields.
  The phase transition occurs due to production and expansion of critical
bubbles. A general analytic expression for the probability of the bubble
formation is obtained, which may be used for study of tunneling in a wide class
of theories.

the presence of external fields and non--trivial topologies of space--time.
