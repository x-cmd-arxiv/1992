polymers in an external field, strands of dipoles in both ferro- and
electrorheological fluids, and flux lines in high-$T_{\tiny C}$ superconductors
bears a close resemblance to the quantum mechanics of bosons in $2+1$
dimensions. We show that single component and binary mixture critical phenomena
in these systems are in the universality class of three dimensional uniaxial
dipolar ferromagnets and ferroelectrics. Our results also apply to films of two
superfluid species undergoing phase separation well below their
$\lambda$-points near $T=0$. In the case of directed polymers and
electrorheological fluids we analyze the effects of free ends occurring in the
sample as well as a novel directionally-dependent compressibility.

the string mass per unit length, $\mu$ under the assumption that cosmic strings
are the source of the measured anisotropy. We find $G\mu = 1.5\pm 0.5 \times

cosmic strings to seed galaxy formation.

Nambu Jona-Lasinio (ENJL) model to $O(p^4)$ in the chiral counting. Two
alternative scenarios are considered on how the ENJL model could originate as a
low energy approximation to QCD. The low energy effective Lagrangian we derive
includes the usual pseudoscalar Goldstone modes, as well as the lower scalar,
vector and axial-vector degrees of freedom. By taking appropriate limits, we
recover most of the effective low-energy models discussed in the literature; in
particular the gauged Yang-Mills vector Lagrangian, the Georgi-Manohar
constituent quark-meson model, and the QCD effective action approach model.
Another property of the ensuing effective Lagrangian is that it incorporates
most of the short-distance relations which follow from QCD. (We derive these
relations in the presence of all possible gluonic interactions to leading order
in the $1/N_c$-expansion.) Finally the numerical predictions are compared to
the experimental values of the low energy parameters

examine the classical dynamics of the vortices and then quantize their motion,
demonstrating that their peculiar classical motion is a result of the fact that
the quantum motion takes place in the lowest Landau level. The classical and
quantum motion in two dimensional regions with boundaries is also investigated.
The quantum theory is not invariant under magnetic translations. Magnetic
translations add total time derivative terms to the collective action, but no
extra constants of the motion result.
