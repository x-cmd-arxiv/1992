theoretic model, in which unitary amplitudes for $1->8$ processes were
obtained. The Born amplitude in this extension has the behavior
$A(1->N)^{tree}\ =\ g^{N-1}\ N!$ expected in a bosonic field theory. Unitarity
is violated when $|A(1->N)|>1$, or when $N>\N_crit\simeq e/g.$ Numerical
solutions of the coupled Schr\""odinger equations shows that for weak coupling
and a large range of $N>\ncrit,$ the exact unitary amplitude is reasonably fit
by a factorized expression $|A(1->N)| \sim (0.73 /N) \cdot \exp{(-0.025/\g2)}$.
The very small size of the coefficient $1/\g2$ , indicative of a very weak
exponential suppression, is not in accord with standard discussions based on
saddle point analysis, which give a coefficient $\sim 1.\ $ The weak dependence
on $N$ could have experimental implications in theories where the exponential
suppression is weak (as in this model). Non-perturbative contributions to
few-point correlation functions in this theory would arise at order $K\ \simeq\
\left((0.05/\g2)+ 2\ ln{N}\right)/ \ ln{(1/\g2)}$ in an expansion in powers of
$\g2.$

understanding of the properties of the models. The double scaling limit is an
indication that a change of the length scale induces a flow in the parameters
of the theory, the size of the matrix and the coupling constants for matrix
models, at constant long distances physics. We construct here these
renormalization group equations at lowest orders in various cases to check that
we reproduce qualitatively the properties of $ c\leq 1 $ models.
