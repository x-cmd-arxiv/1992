correlated percolation model is shown to be only one of an infinite class of
exact mappings. These new cluster representations are a result of
""renormalized"" percolation rules correlated to entire blocks of spins. For
example these rules allow for percolation on ""virtual"" bonds between spins not
present in the underlying Hamiltonian. As a consequence we can define new
random cluster theories each with its own Monte Carlo cluster dynamics that
exactly reproduce the Ising model. By tuning parameters on the critical
percolation surface, it is demonstrated numerically that cluster algorithms can
be formulated for the 2-d and 3-d Ising model that have smaller
autocorrelations than the original Swendsen-Wang algorithm.

discovered via $e u --> e c$ scattering, assuming integrated luminosity of 200
pb$^{-1}$ and charm identification efficiency of 1%. We study the implications
of low energy data for the leptoquarks couplings and find that the most
relevant bound for the HERA cross sections comes from inclusive $c -->
e^+e^-~+~any$. This bound implies that the $e u --> e c$ cross sections for
virtual leptoquarks are just too small for observation of the signal. With an
improvement by a factor of ~2 on the luminosity or on charm identification it
could be possible to see virtual leptoquarks with {\it maximum couplings} up to
~1.5 - 2 TeV. However, the prospects for discovering the virtual particles if
their couplings are somewhat below present bounds are very dim. We point out
that this cross section could be very large for leptoquarks lighter than HERA's
kinematical limit, and if such a leptoquark is discovered we recommend
searching for a possible $e u --> e c$ signal. Our results may also serve as an
update on the maximum cross sections for leptoquark mediated $e u --> \mu c$
scattering.

particular, states with ghost numbers up to 4 appear. However, after taking the
space of the theory to be the Fock space of the Wakimoto free-field

fundamental blocks to build fields with different conformal weights and
