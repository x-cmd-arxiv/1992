dimensional renormalization of low-order Feynman graphs in renormalizable
massless quantum field theories. The beauty of the differential approach is
that it achieves the same finite results as dimensional renormalization without
the need to modify the space time dimension.

matter system. We show that in addition to Galilean invariance the model admits
a set of symmetries generated by fermionic charges, which can be interpreted as
an {\it extended Galilean supersymmetry }. The system also possesses a hidden
conformal invariance and then the full group of symmetries is the {\it extended
superconformal Galilean} group. We also show that imposing extended
superconformal Galilean symmetry determines the values of the coupling
constants in such a way that their values in the bosonic sector agree with the
values of Jackiw and Pi for which self-dual equation exist. We finally analyze
the second quantized version of the model and the two-particle sector.

This is achieved
by generalizing the classical Gel'fand-Dickey brackets to the commutative limit
of the ring of classical pseudodifferential operators in arbitrary dimension.
These $W$-algebras are the Poisson structures associated with a higher
dimensional version of the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya hierarchy (dispersionless
KP-hierarchy). The two dimensional case is worked out explicitly and it is
shown that the role of Diff$S(1)$ is taken by the algebra of generators of
local diffeomorphisms in two dimensions.

renormalizable (or even finite). A comparison with the divergences structure of
