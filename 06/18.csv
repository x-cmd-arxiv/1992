describe the fibers of the Prym map P : R_{g} ---->A_{g-1} inthe cases when it
is dominant, i.e. for g < 7. The most interesting cases are g = 5, where the
fiber is a double cover of the Fano surface of lines on a cubic threefold, and
g=6, where the map is generically finite (of degree 27) with Galois group
WE_{6}, so that the general fiber has the structure of the 27 lines on a cubic
surface. For g > 6, the map is known to be generically injective. The
tetragonal construction gives many counterexamples to injectivity, and we
conjecture that all noninjectivity is due to the tetragonal construction.

on \lisix\ abundances in metal-poor stars has led to a detailed reexamination
of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in the $A\groughly6$ regime. The nuclear reaction
network has been significantly expanded with many new rates added. It is
demonstrated that although a number of $A>7$ reaction rates are poorly
determined, even with extreme values chosen, the standard homogeneous model is
unable to produce significant yields (Be/H and B/H $<10^{-17}$ when $A\le7$
abundances fit) above $A=7$ and the \liseven/\lisix\ ratio always exceeds 500.
We also preliminarily explore inhomogeneous models, such as those inspired by a
first order quark-hadron phase transition, where regions with high
neutron/proton ratios can allow some leakage up to $A>7$. However models that
fit the $A\le7$ abundances still seem to have difficulty in obtaining
significant $A>7$ yields.

In the Abelian case we shall show that the generalized flux problem for
tight-binding models of noninteracting electrons on either $2n$ or $2n+1$
dimensional lattice can always be reduced to a $n$ dimensional hopping problem.
A residual freedom in this reduction enables to identify equivalence classes of
hopping Hamiltonians which have the same spectrum. In the non-Abelian case the
reduction is not possible in general unless the flux tensor factorizes into an
Abelian one times an element of the corresponding algebra.

decay constants ($F_{D}, F_{D_{s}}$) and the form factor for semileptonic

in chiral perturbation theory, using a heavy meson effective Lagrangian and
expanding in inverse powers of the heavy meson mass. To leading order in this
expansion, the leading chiral logarithms and the required counterterms are
determined. At this level, a non-analytic correction to the mass splittings of
${\cal O}(p^3)$ appears, similar the the one found in light baryons. The
correction to $F_{D_{s}}/F_{D}$ is roughly estimated to be of the order of
$10\%$ and, therefore, experimentally accessible, while the correction to the
form factor is likely to be substantially smaller. We explicitly check that the
heavy quark symmetry is preserved by the chiral loops.

approximate symmetry analogous to that of flavor SU(2) and SU(3). This was
specifically realized by an extension of the standard model proposed in 1981.
Two key predictions are that the $\tau$ lifetime should be longer and that the
$\rho$ parameter measured at the Z peak should have an additional negative
contribution. These are consistent with present precision electroweak
measurements. A future decisive test of this model would be the discovery of
new W and Z bosons with nearly degenerate masses of a few TeV.

geometry requires boundary conditions to be imposed there. There is a natural
choice of boundary conditions which match the evaporated black hole solution
onto the linear dilaton vacuum. Below the threshold energy flux no horizon
forms and boundary conditions can be imposed where infalling matter is
reflected from a time-like naked singularity. All information is recovered at

metrics and the dilaton field are explicitly evaluated and the diffeomorphism
invariance is completely fixed in conformal gauge by using the technique
developed in the two dimensional quantum gravity. We argue the relations to the
ADM formalism. The physical state conditions reduce to the usual Wheeler-DeWitt
equations when the dilaton $\df^2 ~ (=\e^{-2\phi}) $ is large enough compared
with $\kappa =(N-51/2)/12$, where $N $ is the number of matter fields. This
corresponds to the large mass limit in the black hole geometry. A singularity
appears at $\df^2 =\kappa (>0) $. The final stage of the black hole evaporation
corresponds to the region $\df^2 \sim \kappa $, where the Liouville term
becomes important, which just comes from the measure of the metrics. If $\kappa
< 0 $, the singularity disappears.
