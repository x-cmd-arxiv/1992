  on surfaces","17 pages, LaTeX",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  The subject of this paper is the problem of arrangement of real algebraic
curves on real algebraic surfaces. In this paper we extend Rokhlin,
Kharlamov-Gudkov-Krakhnov and Kharlamov-Marin congruences for curves on
surfaces and give some applications of this extension.
  For some pairs consisting of a surface and a curve on this surface (in
particular for M-pairs) we introduce a new structure --- the complex separation
that is separation of the complement of curve into two surfaces. In accordance
with Rokhlin terminology the complex separation is a complex topological
characteristic of real algebraic varieties. The complex separation is similar
to complex orientations introduced by O.Ya.Viro (to the absolute complex
orientation in the case when a curve is empty and to the relative complex
orientation otherwise). In some cases we calculate the complex separation of a
surface (for example in the case when surface is the double branched covering
of another surface along a curve). With the help of these calculations
applications of the extension of Rokhlin congruence gives some new restrictions
for complex orientations of curves on a hyperboloid.

nonlinear motion of flux lines of a superconductor driven by an applied

lines from a smooth, laminar phase at small driving forces, to a rough,
turbulent phase when the drive is increased. We explore the nature of these
phases and describe interesting analogies to driven diffusion and growing
interfaces.

multiple Ising models living on dynamical $\phi^3$ graphs and analyse the
behaviour of moments of the graph loop distribution. We notice a universality
at work as the average properties of typical graphs from the ensemble are
determined only by the central charge. We further argue that the qualitative
nature of these results can be understood from considering the effect of
fluctuations about a mean field solution in the Ising sector.

classical and finite groups to physics. In this he is following a tradition at
Yale, established by the late Feza Gursey, and succeeding Gursey in the Gibbs
chair; Gursey in turn, had Pauli as a mentor. Iachello's striking achievement
has been to find an actual realization of arcane supersymmetry within mundane
adjacent even-odd nuclei. Thus far this is the only {\it physical\/} use of
supersymmetry, and its fans surely must be surprised at the venue. Here we
describe the role of $SO(2,1)$ conformal symmetry in non-relativistic
Chern--Simons theory: how it acts, how it controls the nature of solutions, how
it expands to an infinite group on the manifold of static solutions thereby
rendering the static problem completely integrable. Since Iachello has also
used the $SO(2,1)$ group in various contexts, this essay is presented to him on
the occasion of his fiftieth birthday.

visits to the-then Soviet Union in the 1970's and 1980's. His hospitality at
the Moscow Steclov Institute made the trips a pleasure, while the scientific
environment that he provided made them professionally valuable. But it is the
human contact that I remember most vividly and shall now miss after his death.
At a time when issues of conscience were both pressing for attention and
difficult/dangerous to confront, Professor Polivanov made a deep impression
with his quiet but adamant commitment to justice. I can only guess at the
satisfaction he must have felt when his goal of gaining freedom for Yuri Orlov
was attained, and even more so these days when human rights became defensible
in his country; it is regrettable that he cannot now enjoy the future that he
strived to attain.
  One of our joint interests was the Liouville theory,$^{1,\,2}$ which in turn
can be viewed as a model for gravity in two-dimensional space-time. Some recent
developments in this field are here summarized and dedicated to Polivanov's
memory, with the hope that he would have enjoyed knowing about them.

to zero. We argue that, if this model is to give QCD in its continuum limit, it
must have a phase transition. We give arguments to support presence of such a
phase transition.

trace of $\Delta J$ vanishes, being proportional to the trace of the structure
constants. However, the consistent regulator $\cR$, constructed from a general
method, also contains off-diagonal terms. An explicit computation demonstrates
that the regularized Jacobian $Tr\ \Delta J\exp -\cR /M^2$ for $M^2\rightarrow
\infty $ is the variation of a local counterterm, which we give. This is a
direct proof at the level of path integrals that there is no BRST anomaly.

It turns out that this covariant action is nothing but a Fourier transform of
the WZW action. The same general formula provides a geometrical interpretation
of $W$ transformations: they are just homotopy contractions of ordinary gauge
transformations. This is used to argue that the moduli space relevant to $W$
gravity is part of the moduli space of $G$-bundles over a Riemann surface.
