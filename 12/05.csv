describe an arbitrary number of charged black holes in a spacetime with
positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In the limit $\Lambda=0$, these
solutions reduce to the well known Majumdar-Papapetrou (MP) solutions. Like the
MP solutions, each black hole in a $\Lambda >0$ solution has charge $Q$ equal
to its mass $M$, up to a possible overall sign. Unlike the $\Lambda = 0$ limit,
however, solutions with $\Lambda >0$ are highly dynamical. The black holes move
with respect to one another, following natural trajectories in the background
deSitter spacetime. Black holes moving apart eventually go out of causal
contact. Black holes on approaching trajectories ultimately merge. To our
knowledge, these solutions give the first analytic description of coalescing
black holes. Likewise, the thermodynamics of the $\Lambda >0$ solutions is
quite interesting. Taken individually, a $|Q|=M$ black hole is in thermal
equilibrium with the background deSitter Hawking radiation. With more than one
black hole, because the solutions are not static, no global equilibrium
temperature can be defined. In appropriate limits, however, when the black
holes are either close together or far apart, approximate equilibrium states
are established.

explicit construction that a proper treatment of the Gribov ambiguity leads to
a highly non-trivial structure of all physical states in these quantum field
theory models. The especially interesting example of massless QCD is discussed
in more detail: There, some of the special static gauge transformations which
are responsible for the Gribov ambiguity also lead to a spectral flow, and this
implies a chiral condensate in all physical states. We also show that the
latter is closely related to the Schwinger term and the chiral anomaly.

solution of the $\d$-equation, which satisfies simultaneously a good $L_\i$
estimate and a good $L_1$ estimate. This appears as a special case of our main
result which can be stated as follows: Let $(\Omega,\cal{A},\mu)$ be any
measure space. Consider a bounded operator $u:H^1\ra L_1(\mu)$. Assume that on
one hand $u$ admits an extension $u_1:L^1\ra L_1(\mu)$ bounded with norm $C_1$,
and on the other hand that $u$ admits an extension $u_\i:L^\i\ra L_\i(\mu)$
bounded with norm $C_\i$. Then $u$ admits an extension $\w{u}$ which is bounded
simultaneously from $L^1$ into $ L_1(\mu)$ and from $L^\i$ into $ L_\i(\mu)$
