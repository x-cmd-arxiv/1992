the techniques of the effective action and finite temperature field theory. The
nonlinear constraint is implemented through a Lagrange multiplier. The finite
temperature effective potential for this multiplier is calculated at one loop.
The existence of a nontrivial minimum for this potential is the signal of a
disordered phase in which the lowest excited state is a massive triplet. The
mass gap is easily calculated as a function of temperature in dimensions 1, 2
and 3. In dimension 1, this gap is known as the Haldane gap, and its
temperature dependence is compared with experimental results.

interaction makes it possible that the theory is renormalized as an interacting
continuum theory at the critical line in the ladder approximation. Extra higher
dimensional operators (``counter terms'') are not needed for the theory to be
renormalized. By virtue of the effective potential approach, the
renormalization (``symmetric renormalization'') is performed in a
phase-independent manner both for the symmetric and the spontaneously broken
phases of the chiral symmetry. We explicitly obtain $\beta$ function having a
nontrivial ultraviolet fixed line for the renormalized coupling as well as the
bare one. In both phases the anomalous dimension is very large ($ \ge 1$)
without discontinuity across the fixed line. Operator product expansion is
explicitly constructed, which is consistent with the large anomalous dimension
owing to the appearance of the nontrivial extra power behavior in the Wilson
coefficient for the unit operator. The symmetric renormalization breaks down at
the critical gauge coupling, which is cured by the generalized renormalization
scheme (``$\tM$-dependent renormalization''). Also emphasized is the formal
resemblance to the four-fermion theory in less than four dimensions which is
renormalizable in $1/N$ expansion.

"math/9212201",,"Sy D. Friedman (MIT)","Jensen's \Sigma^* theory and the combinatorial content of V=L",,,,"Logic E-prints December 02, 1992","math.LO",,"  The purpose of this article is to indicate how a reformulation of Jensen's
$\Sigma^*$ theory (developed for the study of core models) can be used to
provide a more satisfactory treatment of uniformization, hulls and Skolem
functions for the $J_\alpha$'s. Then we use this approach to fine structure to
formulate a principle intended to capture the combinatorial content of the
axiom $V=L.$

"math/9212202",,"Sy D. Friedman (MIT)","A large Pi-1-2 set absolute for set forcing",,,,"Logic E-prints December 02, 1992","math.LO",,"  Let k be a definable L-cardinal. Then there is a set of reals X,
class-generic over L, such that L(X) and L have the same cardinals, X has size
k in L(X) and some pi-1-2 formula defines X in all set-generic extensions of
L(X). Two corollaries, both assuming the consistency of an inaccessible: It is
consistent for the Perfect Set Property to hold for boldface sigma-1-2 sets,
yet fail for some lightface pi-1-2 set. It is consistent that the Perfect Set
Property holds for boldface sigma-1-2 sets yet some lightface pi-1-2
wellordering of some set of reals has length aleph-1000.

($^3\!$He,t) reaction is discussed in terms of a nuclear response function. The
medium effects modifying a $\Delta$- and a pion propagation were considered for
a finite size nucleus. The Glauber approach has been used for distortion of a
$^3\!$He and a triton in the initial and the final states. The effects
determining the peak positions and its width are discussed. Large displacement
width for the $\Delta$ - h excitations and considerable contribution of
coherent pion production were found for the reaction on $^{12}$C.
