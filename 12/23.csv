Recent calculations have led to apparently contradictory results for the
influence of the massive body on the propagation of the waves. We show here
that the results are in fact consistent and in agreement with the ``standard''
viewpoint in which the high frequency compact source produces the radiation as
if in a flat background, and the background curvature affects the propagation
of these waves.

$(m_h,m_t)$ plane depends on the scale $\Lambda$, below which the theory
remains perturbative, and the supersymmetry breaking scale $\Lambda_s$, that we
fix to $1\ TeV$. In the minimal model with $\Lambda=10^{16}\ GeV$: $m_h<130\

gauge singlets and $\Lambda=10^{16}\ GeV$: $m_h<145\ GeV$ and $m_t<185\ GeV$.
We also consider supersymmetric standard models with arbitrary Higgs sectors.
For models whose couplings saturate the scale $\Lambda=10^{16}\ GeV$ we find
$m_h<155\ GeV$ and $m_t<190\ GeV$. As one pushes the saturation scale $\Lambda$
down to $\Lambda_s$, the bounds on $m_h$ and $m_t$ increase. For instance, in
models with $\Lambda=10\ TeV$, the upper bounds for $m_h$ and $m_t$ go to $415\
