the $t$-$J$ model. The analysis of different parametrizations in the functional
representation shows that (i) calculations which take into account constraints
for the number of on-site-available states are describing quasiparticles in
terms of wrong local statistics, and contain gauge non-invariant objects; (ii)
application of the projection technique in the slave-boson(fermion)
representation reproduces the correct statistics, and is exactly equivalent to
the conventional diagram technique for Hubbard operators; (iii) it is necessary
to introduce an additional equation for the effective hopping amplitude for the
flux phase. With the technique for Hubbard operators, which allows one to
separate charge and spin channels we construct the mean-field equations for a
flux-like state which coexists with N\'eel antiferromagnetism (AF). The formal
analysis shows that the equations for real and imaginary parts of the effective
hopping amplitude are inconsistent for any $\theta \neq 0$ (including $\theta
=\pi /4$ which gives flux 1/2). The hopping amplitude is slightly supressed by
exchange renormalization. The N\'eel magnetization $m$ decreases with
increasing concentration of holes. The region where antiferromagnetism exists
is decreasing

"gr-qc/9212015",,"J.H. Yoon","(1+1)-Dimensional Methods for General Relativity","16pp, latex",,,"SNUTP-92-104","gr-qc",,"  This is an article contributed to the Brill Festschrift, in honor of the 60th
birthday of Prof. D.R. Brill, which will appear in the Vol.2 of the Proceedings
of the International Symposia on Directions in General Relativity. In this
article we present the (1+1)-dimensional method for studying general relativity
of 4-dimensions. We first discuss the general formalism, and subsequently draw
attention to the algebraically special class of space-times, following the
Petrov classification. It is shown that this class of space-times can be
described by the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills action interacting with matter
fields, with the spacial diffeomorphisms of the 2-surface as the gauge
symmetry. The constraint appears polynomial in part, whereas the non-polynomial
part is a non-linear sigma model type in (1+1)-dimensions. It is also shown
that the representations of $w_{\infty}$-gravity appear naturally as special
cases of this description, and we discuss briefly the $w_{\infty}$-geometry in
term of the fibre bundle.

hole spacetimes (Schwarzschild and Reissner - Nordstr\o m), and De Sitter space
(in static coordinates to allow a better comparison with the black hole case).
We solve the first order string fluctuations around the center of mass motion
at spatial infinity, near the horizon and at the spacetime singularity. We find
that the time components are always well behaved in the three regions and in
the three backgrounds. The radial components are {\it unstable}: imaginary
frequencies develop in the oscillatory modes near the horizon, and the
evolution is like $(\tau-\tau_0)^{-P}$, $(P>0)$, near the spacetime
singularity, $r\to0$, where the world - sheet time $(\tau-\tau_0)\to0$, and the
proper string length grows infinitely. In the Schwarzschild black hole, the
angular components are always well - behaved, while in the Reissner - Nordstr\o
m case they develop instabilities inside the horizon, near $r\to0$ where the
repulsive effects of the charge dominate over those of the mass. In general,
whenever large enough repulsive effects in the gravitational background are
present, string instabilities develop. In De Sitter space, all the spatial
components exhibit instability. The infalling of the string to the black hole
singularity is like the motion of a particle in a potential
$\gamma(\tau-\tau_0)^{-2}$ where $\gamma$ depends on the $D$ spacetime
dimensions and string angular momentum, with $\gamma>0$ for Schwarzschild and
$\gamma<0$ for Reissner - Nordstr\o m black holes. For $(\tau-\tau_0)\to0$ the
string ends trapped by the black hole singularity.

"hep-ph/9212314","Myron Bander","Myron Bander and H. R. Rubinstein","On the 545 keV Line in the Spectrum of the Crab Nebula","pages (set in Revtex II)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The GRANAT group (R. Sunyaev {\it et al.\/}, Central Bureau of Astronomical
Telegrams, International Astronomical Union, Circular No.~5481) recently
reported the observation of a $(545 \pm 11)$ keV line in the spectrum of the
Crab Nebula. It is tempting to associate this with the positron-electron
annihilation line at 511 keV. If this line originates from some transition at
the surface of the neutron star in the Crab, we expect a red shift of around
10\% rather then the observed blue shift of $\sim 35$ keV; in fact, this
gravitational red shift implies that the natural frequency of the observed line
is also 10\% higher, or around 600 keV. In this article we shall present a
mechanism for generating such a split from 511 keV. For this mechanism to be
successful we require: (a) surface magnetic fields, in the annihilation region,
to be $(3-8)\times 10^{12}$~G and to point in our direction, (b) surface
densities of $(10^5-10^6)$ g/cc. Both of these assumptions are consistent with
pulsar models.

(quaternion-K\""ahler) geometry and solve the differential constraints which
define this geometry. To this end the original $4n$-dimensional quaternionic
manifold is extended to a bi-harmonic space. The latter includes additional
harmonic coordinates associated with both the tangent local $Sp(1)$ group and
an extra rigid $SU(2)$ group rotating the complex structures. Then the
constraints can be rewritten as integrability conditions for the existence of
an analytic subspace in the bi-harmonic space and solved in terms of two
unconstrained potentials on the analytic subspace. Geometrically, the
potentials have the meaning of vielbeins associated with the harmonic
coordinates. We also establish a one-to-one correspondence between the
quaternionic spaces and off-shell $N=2$ supersymmetric sigma-models coupled to
$N=2$ supergravity. The general $N=2$ sigma-model Lagrangian when written in
the harmonic superspace is composed of the quaternionic potentials. Coordinates
of the analytic subspace are identified with superfields describing $N=2$
matter hypermultiplets and a compensating hypermultiplet of $N=2$ supergravity.
As an illustration we present the potentials for the symmetric quaternionic
spaces.
