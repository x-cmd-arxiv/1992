magnetoconductance, G(B), of ballistic cavities and use it to test the
semiclassical theory of quantum billiards. G(B) is qualitatively different for
chaotic and regular cavities, an effect explained semiclassically by the
differing classical distribution of areas. The magnitude of G(B) is poorly
explained by the semiclassical theory of coherent backscattering (elastic
enhancement factor)-- correlations beyond time-reversed pairs of trajectories
must be included-- but is in agreement with random matrix theory.

experimentally and numerically. When granular material falls through a long
narrow pipe one observes recurrent clogging. The kinetic energy of the falling
particles increases up to a characteristic threshold corresponding to the onset
of recurrent clogging and density waves of no definite wavelength. The
distances between regions of high density depend strongly on the initial
conditions. They vary irregularly without any characteristic time and length
scale. The particle-flow was investigated using 2D Molecular Dynamics
simulations. Experimental investigations lead to equivalent results.

investigated. The supersymmetric order parameter is the V.E.V. of the neutral

It is normally assumed that to get a hard scattering in diffraction, one may
treat the Pomeron as an ordinary particle, which has distributions of gluons
and quarks. We show that this is not so: When we use perturbative QCD, there is
a breakdown of the factorization theorem. The whole Pomeron can initiate the
hard scattering, even though it is not point-like. Qualitatively, but not
quantitatively, this gives the same effect as a delta function term in the
gluon density in a Pomeron.

models satisfying the same physical inputs as Polyakov's solution (p,q)=(2,21).
Dynamical magnetic fields and passive scalars pose different physical
requirements. For large magnetic Reynolds number other minimal models arise.
The simplest one, (p,q)=(2,13) makes reasonable predictions that may be tested
in the astrophysical context. In particular, the equipartition theorem between
magnetic and kinetic energies does not hold: the magnetic one dominates at
larger distances.
