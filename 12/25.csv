is investigated. It is shown, that the asymptotic behaviour of the CF depends
on the shape and the local geometry of the Fermi surface. In particular, the
exponent of power law which describes the damping of Friedel oscillations at
large r (-4 for an isotropic Fermi gas) is determined by local geometry of the
FS. The applications of the obtained results to calculations of the CF in a
metal near the electron topological transition and of the RKKY exchange
integral are considered as well.

field-theoretic systems with boundary coupling to a realistic heat bath. In the
free-field case the method is equivalent to an infinite extension of the system
beyond the boundary, while in the interacting case the extension of the system
is done in linear approximation. We use this technique to study kink-antikink
dynamics in $\varphi^4$ field theory in 1+1 dimensions.

We give a recursion relation that expresses the scalar $n$-point integral as a
cyclicly symmetric combination of $(n-1)$-point integrals. The computation of
such integrals thus reduces to the calculation of box diagrams ($n=4$). The
tensor integrals required in gauge theory may be obtained by differentiating
the scalar integral with respect to certain combinations of the kinematic
variables. Such relations also lead to differential equations for scalar
integrals. For box integrals with massless internal lines these differential
equations are easy to solve.

transitions is found for $E_x \gsim$ 800 keV above yrast, which represents the
onset of rotational damping. Above $E_x \approx $ 2 MeV, energy levels and E2
strengths display fluctuations typical of quantum chaotic systems, which are
determined by the high multipole components of the two-body residual
interaction.
