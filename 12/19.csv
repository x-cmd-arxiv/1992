Gaussian-distributed random, infinite-range exchange interactions. A complete
solution is obtained at $M=\infty$ in the spin-glass and quantum-disordered
phases. The quantum phase transition separating them is found to possess
logarithmic violations of scaling, with no further modifications to the leading
critical behavior at any order in $1/M$; this suggests that the critical
properties of the transverse-field Ising model (believed to be identical to the
$M\rightarrow 1$ limit) are the same as those of the $M=\infty$ quantum rotors.

explicitly. Next, we show that in the limit of strong interaction the ""spin""

invariant excitations of the strong coupling vacuum. The fundamental
approximation scheme then consists of i) a truncation of the infinite set of

an expansion of the truncated wavefunctions in terms of the remaining clusters
rearranged, or ``shifted'', to describe gauge invariant {\em fluctuations}
