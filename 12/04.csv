existence of non-standard (``fake'' or ``exotic'') differentiable structures on
topologically simple manifolds such as $S^7$, \R and $S^3\times {\bf R^1}.$
Because of the technical difficulties involved in the smooth case, we begin
with an easily understood toy example looking at the role which the choice of
complex structures plays in the formulation of two-dimensional vacuum
electrostatics. We then briefly review the mathematical formalisms involved
with differentiable structures on topological manifolds, diffeomorphisms and
their significance for physics. We summarize the important work of Milnor,
Freedman, Donaldson, and others in developing exotic differentiable structures
on well known topological manifolds. Finally, we discuss some of the geometric
implications of these results and propose some conjectures on possible physical
implications of these new manifolds which have never before been considered as
physical models.

P.G.Silvestrov, BUDKERINP 92--92. The total cross-section for baryon number
violating processes at high energies is usually parametrized as
$\sigma_{total}\propto\exp(\frac{4\pi}{\alpha} F(\varepsilon))$, where
$\varepsilon =\sqrt{s}/E_0 , \,\, E_0 = \sqrt{6} \pi m_w/\alpha$. In the
present paper the third nontrivial term of the expansion \[ F(\varepsilon)=
-1+\frac{9}{8}\varepsilon^{4/3} -\frac{9}{16}\varepsilon^2 -\frac{9}{32} \left(
\frac{m_h}{m_w}\right)^2 \varepsilon^{8/3}\log\left(
\frac{1}{3\varepsilon}\left( \frac{2m_w}{\gamma m_h}\right)^2 \right) +
O(\varepsilon^{8/3}) \] is obtained.The unknown corrections to $F(\varepsilon)$
are expected to be of the order of $\varepsilon^{8/3}$, but have neither
$(m_h/m_w)^2$, nor $\log(\varepsilon)$ enhancement. The total cross-section is
extremely sensitive to the value of single Instanton action. The correction to
Instanton action $\triangle S\sim (m\rho)^4 \log(m\rho)/g^2$ is found ($\rho$
is the Instanton radius). For sufficiently heavy Higgs boson the $\rho$
-dependent part of the Instanton action is changed drastically. In this case
even the leading contribution to $F(\varepsilon)$, responsible for a growth of
cross-section due to the multiple production of classical W-bosons, is changed:
\[ F(\varepsilon)=-1+ \frac{9}{8}\left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^{2/3}
\varepsilon^{4/3} +\ldots \,\, , \,\, \varepsilon\ll 1\ll \varepsilon \left(
\frac{m_h}{m_w} \right)^{3/2} \,\, . \]

constraints on $S$ and $T$ from these observables. For comparison, the much
smaller scale of $s$-quark contributions to the weak charge measured in atomic
PV is quantified. It is likely that only in the case of heavy muonic atoms
could nucleon strangeness enter the weak charge at an observable level.

therefore are topological solitons. The effective Lagrangian for $V$ is derived
in models with adjoint and fundamental quarks. In 3+1 dimensions the explicit
