  Kocic et al. in non-compact, quenched QED is tested. No phase transition is
found. This shows that divergence of the `monopole susceptibility' introduced
by Hands and Wensley is not a reliable indicator of second order phase
transitions. In view of these results
  I discuss claims that the chiral phase transition seen in QED with fermions
is a lattice artefact driven by monopole condensation.

as calculated in quenched QCD contains physics which can be ascribed to the
pion cloud of the nucleon. In particular, it is argued that the physics
corresponding to one-pion loops in chiral perturbation theory are included in
the quenched approximation.

magnetic moments are computed. The calculation includes contributions from both
intermediate octet and decuplet baryon states. Unlike the one-loop
contributions to the baryon axial currents and masses, the contribution from
decuplet intermediate states does not partially cancel that from octet
intermediate states. The fit to the observed magnetic moments including
$m_q^{1/2}$ corrections is found to be much worse than the tree level SU(3) fit
if values for the baryon-pion axial coupling constants obtained from a tree
level extraction are used. Using the axial coupling constant values extracted
at one loop results in a better fit to the magnetic moments than the tree level
SU(3) fit. There are three linear relations amongst the magnetic moments when
$m_q^{1/2}$ corrections are included, and one relation including $m_q^{1/2}$,
$m_q\ln m_q$ and $m_q$ corrections. These relations are independent of the
axial coupling constants of the baryons and agree well with experiment.

obtained in the theory of a scalar field coupled to gravity with the dilaton,
i.e. the Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. The value of the dilaton is determined in
terms of the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. In particular, the solutions exist
for any $\omega>0$ and as $\omega\to\infty$ we obtain new solutions in general
relativity. They have horizons whose sizes depend on $\omega$.

"math/9212210","Mikhail Lyubich","Mikhail Lyubich","Combinatorics, geometry and attractors of quasi-quadratic maps",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1992/18","math.DS",,"  The Milnor problem on one-dimensional attractors is solved for S-unimodal
maps with a non-degenerate critical point c. It provides us with a complete
understanding of the possible limit behavior for Lebesgue almost every point.
This theorem follows from a geometric study of the critical set $\omega(c)$ of
a ""non-renormalizable"" map. It is proven that the scaling factors
characterizing the geometry of this set go down to 0 at least exponentially.
This resolves the problem of the non-linearity control in small scales. The
proofs strongly involve ideas from renormalization theory and holomorphic
dynamics.
