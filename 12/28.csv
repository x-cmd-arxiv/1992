(FQHE) on the torus are constructed. The multi-component nature of anyon wave
functions and the degeneracy of FQHE on the torus are very clear reflected in
this kind of wave functions. We also calculate the braid statistics of the
quasiparticles in FQHE on the torus and show they fit to the picture of anyons
interacting with magnetic field on the torus obtained from braid group
analysis.
