$K^o \bar K^o$ when observed in identical decay modes like $K_S K_S$ in
multiparticle final states containing many partial waves. No enhancement is
found in any single partial wave and all partial wave analyses of the s-wave
threshold resonance $a_o$ and $f_o$ should give the same results for all decay
modes. In CP violation experiments where $B^o - \bar B^o$ pairs are inclusively
produced and correlated decays into $\psi K_S$ and leptonic modes are observed,
the CP-violating lepton asymmetry is enhanced by a factor of two in the
kinematic region where Bose enhancement occurs.

$w_{1+\infty}$ to include more fields as the coset parameters. This can be done
either by choosing a smaller stability subalgebra in the nonlinear realization
of $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetry, or by considering a nonlinear realization of some
extended symmetry, or by combining both options. We show that all these
possibilities give rise to the multi-field realizations of $w_{1+\infty}$. We
deduce the two-field realization of $w_{1+\infty}$ proceeding from a coset
space of the symmetry group $\tilde{G}$ which is an extension of $w_{1+\infty}$
by the second self-commuting set of higher spin currents. Next, starting with
the unextended $w_{1+\infty}$ but placing all its spin 2 generators into the
coset, we obtain a new two-field realization of $w_{1+\infty}$ which
essentially involves a $2D$ dilaton. In order to construct the invariant action
for this system we add one more field and so get a new three-field realization
of $w_{1+\infty}$. We re-derive it within the coset space approach, by applying
the latter to an extended symmetry group $\hat{G}$ which is a nonlinear
deformation of $\tilde{G}$. Finally we present some multi-field generalizations
of our three-field realization and discuss several intriguing parallels with
$N=2$ strings and conformal affine Toda theories.
