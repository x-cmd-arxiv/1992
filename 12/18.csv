string Green functions are represented as a path integral over random surfaces.
Topological excitations play an important role in the early universe. In the
broken symmetry phase of the $U(1)$ spin model, closed global cosmic strings
arise, while in the Higgs phase of the noncompact gauge-Higgs model, local
cosmic strings are present. The compact gauge-Higgs model also involves
monopoles. Then the strings can break if their ends are capped by monopoles.
The topology of the Euclidean string world sheets are studied by numerical
simulations.

describing matter coupled to topological gravity in two dimensions: topological
theories, Virasoro constraints on integrable hierarchies, and a DDK-type
formalism. With the help of the Kontsevich-Miwa transform, we solve the
Virasoro constraints on the KP hierarchy in terms of minimal models dressed
with a (free) Liouville-like scalar. The dressing prescription originates in a
topological (twisted N=2) theory. The Virasoro constraints are thus related to
essentially the N=2 null state decoupling equations. The N=2 generators are
constructed out of matter, the `Liouville' scalar, and $c=-2$ ghosts. By a
`dual' construction involving the reparametrization $c=-26$ ghosts, the DDK
dressing prescription is reproduced from the N=2 symmetry. As a by-product we
thus observe that there are two ways to dress arbitrary $d\leq1$ or $d\geq25$
matter theory, that allow its embedding into a topological theory. By th e
Kontsevich-Miwa transform, which introduces an infinite set of `time' variables
$t_r$, the equations ensuring the vanishing of correlators that involve
BRST-exact primary states, factorize through the Virasoro generators expressed
in terms of the $t_r$. The background charge of these Virasoro generators is
determined by the topological central charge.
