Moriya [T.\ Moriya, {\it Phys.\ Rev.}~{\bf 120} 91, (1960)] for two of the
insulating parent compounds of the cuprate superconductors: (1)
La$_{2-x}$Nd$_x$CuO$_4$ where the CuO$_6$ octahedra forming each Cu-O layer are
tilted in staggered fashion about an axis which depends on $x$ and temperature;
and (2) YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ ($x \alt 0.4$) where the Cu-O layers form
CuO$_2$-Y-CuO$_2$ bilayers in which the in-plane O$^{2-}$ ions are displaced
uniformly towards the Y$^{3+}$ layer. For (1) a simple formula is derived for
the weak ferromagnetic moment in each Cu-O layer as a function of the tilting
axis and magnitude. For (2) it is shown that the anisotropic corrections to
superexchange are different from what has previously been assumed. For the
correct spin Hamiltonian a classical N\'eel state in which the Cu spins are
lying in the plane is unstable in a single Cu-O layer, but when a bilayer is
considered there is a critical value of the interlayer exchange coupling which
stabilizes this state. For both cases (1) and (2) spin-wave spectra are
calculated and shown to compare favorably with experiment.

either by randomizing the coupling between grains (Model A disorder) or by
removing grains (Model B disorder). Three types of defects are considered:
point disorder, random line disorder, and periodic line disorder; but the
emphasis is on random line disorder. Static and dynamic properties of the

analogous coupled overdamped Josephson equations in the presence of thermal
noise. Random line defects considerably raise the superconducting transition
temperature T$_c(B)$, and increase the apparent critical current density
J$_c(B,T)$, in comparison to the defect-free crystal. They are more effective
in these respects than a comparable volume density of point defects, in
agreement with the experiments of Civale {\it et al}. Periodic line defects
commensurate with the flux lattice are found to raise T$_c(B)$ even more than
do random line defects. Random line defects are most effective when their
density approximately equals the flux density. Near T$_c(B)$, our static and

feature of the spectrum in a natural way. The inter-family hierarchy is first
generated by radiative phenomena in a sector of heavy isosinglet fermions and
then transferred to quarks by means of a universal seesaw. A crucial role is
played by left-right parity and up-down isotopic symmetry. No family symmetry

monodromy-matrix based non-perturbative covariant path-integral approach to
{\it polynomial invariants} of knots and links in the framework of
(topological) quantum Chern-Simons field theory is given. An idea of
``physical'' observables represented by an auxiliary topological
quantum-mechanics model in an external gauge field is introduced substituting
rather a limited notion of the Wilson loop. Thus, the possibility of using
various generalizations of the Chern-Simons action (also higher-dimensional
ones) as well as a purely functional language becomes open. The theory is
quantized in the framework of the best suited in this case {\it
antibracket-antifield} formalism of Batalin and Vilkovisky. Using the Stokes
theorem and formal translational invariance of the path-integral measure a {\it
monodromy matrix} corresponding to an arbitrary pair of irreducible
representations of an arbitrary semi-simple Lie group is derived.

k-Dirac operator is related to the second Casimir (the k-deformed squared
Pauli-Lubanski vector). The ``spinorial'' realization of the k-Poincare` is
obtained by a contraction of the coproduct of the real form of SO_q(3,2) using
the 4-dimensional representation which results to be, up some scalar factors,
the same of the undeformed algebra in terms of the usual gamma matrices.

the ring-sum correlation energy. The model parameters are adjusted
self-consistently to give the canonical saturation density and binding energy
per nucleon with the ring energy included. Two models are considered,
mean-field-theory where we neglect vacuum effects, and the relativistic Hartree
approximation where such effects are included but in an approximate way. In
both cases we find self-consistent solutions and present equations of state. In
the mean-field case the ring energy completely dominates the attractive part of
the energy density and the elegant saturation mechanism of the standard
approach is lost, namely relativistic quenching of the scalar attraction. In
the relativistic Hartree approach the vacuum effects are included in an
approximate manner using vertex form factors with a cutoff of 1 - 2 GeV, the
range expected from QCD. Due to the cutoff, the ring energy for this case is
significantlysmaller, and we obtain self-consistent solutions which preserve
the basic saturation mechanism of the standard relativistic approach.
