loitering phase. We compare the nonlinear mass distribution to that in a
standard, matter dominated cosmology. The statistical aspects of the clustered
matter are found to be robust to changes in the expansion law, an exception
being that the peculiar velocities are lower by a factor of $\sim 3$ in the
loitering model. Further, in the loitering scenario, nonlinear growth of
perturbation occurs more recently ($z\sim 3-5$) than in the matter dominated
case. Differences in the high redshift appearances of the two models will
result but observable consequences depend critically on the chosen form, onset
and duration of the loitering phase.

representation of quantum fluctuations. The quantum to classical transition of
fluctuations is naturally implemented by decohering the density matrix in this
representation. The entropy of the decohered vacua is derived. It is shown that
the decoherence process breaks the physical equivalence between vacua that
differ by a coordinate dependent phase generated by a surface term in the
Lagrangian. In particular, scale invariant power spectra are only obtained for
a special choice of surface term.

$\beta_T/\beta_V$ fixed $\ltapprox 2$. Taken as a whole, the data cast doubt on

analysis of bosonic matter coupled to two dimensional gravity. Therefore,
supersymmetry breaking is not the physical mechanism that creates non
perturbative effects in the case of points of even multicriticality $k$. Non
perturbative effects in the string coupling constant $g_{str}$ result in a loss
of any explicit relation to the KdV hierarchy equations in the latter case,
while maintaining the perturbative genus expansion. As a by-product of our
analysis it is explicitly proved that polynomials orthogonal relative to an
arbitrary weight $\exp (-\beta V(x))$ along the whole real line obey an
Hartree-Fock equation.
