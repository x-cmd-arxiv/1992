near the critical temperature displays universal finite-size effects which can
be described in terms of a gaussian model of capillary waves. It turns out that
these finite-size corrections depend rather strongly on the shape of the
lattice. This prediction, which has no adjustable parameters, is tested and
accurately verified for various lattice shapes by means of numerical
simulations with a cluster algorithm. This supports also a long-standing
conjecture on the finite-size effects in Wilson loops of Lattice Gauge
Theories.

relativistic action of Wilson and the nonrelativistic and static actions appear
as special cases. It is valid at all values of $m_q a$, including $m_q a

the nonrelativistic action of Thacker and Lepage, and to the static action of
Eichten.

infinity. The phase structure is explored and the relevant phase transition is
found to be consistent with a second order one. The fermionic mass spectrum
close to that transition is discussed and a first non-perturbative estimate of
the influence of fermions on the upper and lower bounds on the renormalized
scalar self-coupling is given. Numerical results are confronted with
perturbative predictions.

describes the high temperature limit of ordinary lattice gauge theories in
$d+1$ dimensions. The matter fields are related to the Polyakov loops, while
the spatial gauge variables become the gauge fields of the K-M model. This
interpretation of the K-M model is in agreement with some recent results in
high temperature lattice QCD.

completely different, with even the sign of the effect being opposite for
Maxwell-Chern-Simons fields and scalar fields. We further examine the effect of
finite temperature. The Casimir stress is found to be attractive at both low
