solutions are constructed within the SU(2) sector of 4-dimensional heterotic
string effective action. They separate topologically distinct Yang-Mills vacua
and are qualitatively similar to the Einstein-Yang-Mills spha- lerons and
non-abelian black holes discussed recently. New solutions possess quantized
values of the dilaton charge.
