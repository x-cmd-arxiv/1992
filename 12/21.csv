simplest version of the Kazakov-Migdal model of induced QCD. In this paper we
compute the spectrum of small fluctuations around Gross's semi-circular
solution. By solving Migdal's wave equation we find a string-like spectrum
which, in four dimensions, corresponds to the infinite tower of mesons in
strong coupling lattice QCD with adjoint matter. In one dimension our formula
reproduces correctly the well known spectrum of the hermitean matrix model with
a harmonic oscillator potential. We comment on the relevance of our results to
the possibility of the model describing extended objects in more than one
dimension.

disordered phases. The ordered phase is found to allow admixture of disordered
domains induced by a long-range attraction acting between the two different
non-favored spins. This phenomenon gives an explanation of why the first-order
phase transitions associated with the global \(Z_3\) symmetry are so weak.

problems. In the standard model, as a result, one cannot calculate the
effective potential for arbitrarily small values of $\phi$, the Higgs
expectation value. Because the Higgs field is now known not to be extremely
light, it is necessary to determine whether perturbation theory is a reliable
guide to properties of the weak phase transition. In this note, we evaluate the
most singular contributions to the potential at two loops as well as the
leading strong interaction contributions. Above the critical temperature, the
strong interaction corrections are reasonably small, while the weak corrections
are about 10\%, even for rather small values of the Higgs field. At the
critical temperature, the weak corrections have a more substantial effect,
rendering the transition significantly more first order, but not significantly
changing the upper bound on the Higgs mass required for baryogenesis.

contribution is calculated and compared to the purely perturbative

effect on $\Delta I = 1/2$ strangeness-changing matrix elements after

the number of final particles is shown to be also small, and the probability of
the transition is suppressed by $\exp(-2S_0)$, where $S_0$ is the instanton
action. This solution, however, does not correspond to the maximum transition
probability among all states with given number of incoming particles and
energy. Unless the limit $g^2 n_{initial}\to0$ is exponentially sensitive to
the structure of the initial state, our results imply that well above the
