consider valence bonds singlets, constructed by Schwinger bosons or fermions,
which are variational ground states for quantum antiferromagnets. This
expansion is simpler than the familiar expansions of the quantum Heisenberg
model, and thus more instructive. The diagrammatic rules of this expansion
allow us to prove certain identities to all orders in 1/N. We derive the
on-site spin fluctuations sum rule for arbitrary N. We calculate the
correlations of the one dimensional Valence Bonds Solid states and the
Gutzwiller Projected Fermi Gas upto order 1/N. For the bosons case, we are
surprised to find that the mean field, the order 1/N and the exact correlations
are simply proportional. For the fermions case, the 1/N correction enhances the
zone edge singularity. The comparison of our leading order terms to known
results for N=2, enhances our understanding of large-N approximations in
general.

transition moment for the $N \; \gamma \to \Delta$ channel is found to be in
agreement with recent experimental analyses. The lattice results indicate
$\mu_{p \Delta} / \mu_p = 0.88(15)$. In terms of the Particle Data Group
convention, $f_{M1} = 0.231(41)$ GeV${}^{-1/2}$ for $p \; \gamma \to \Delta^+$
transitions. Lattice predictions for the hyperon $M1$ transition moments agree
with those of a simple quark model. However the manner in which the quarks
contribute to the transition moments in the lattice simulation is different
from that anticipated by quark model calculations. The scalar quadrupole form
factor exhibits a behavior consistent with previous multipole analyses. The
$E2/M1$ multipole transition moment ratios are also determined. The lattice
results suggest $R_{EM} \equiv -{\cal G}_{E2}/{\cal G}_{M1} = +3\pm 8$ \% for
$p \; \gamma \to \Delta^+$ transitions. Of particular interest are significant
nonvanishing signals for the $E2/M1$ ratio in $\Xi^-$ and $\Sigma^-$

D48 (1993) 800-815","10.1103/PhysRevD.48.800",,"hep-th",,"  We study the dynamics of phase transitions out of equilibrium in weakly
coupled scalar field theories. We consider the case in which there is a rapid
supercooling from an initial symmetric phase in thermal equilibrium at
temperature $T_i>T_c$ to a final state at low temperature $T_f \approx 0$. In
particular we study the formation and growth of correlated domains out of
equilibrium. It is shown that the dynamics of the process of domain formation
and growth (spinodal decomposition) cannot be studied in perturbation theory,
and a non-perturbative self-consistent Hartree approximation is used to study
the long time evolution. We find in weakly coupled theories that the size of
domains grow at long times as $\xi_D(t) \approx \sqrt{t\xi(0)}$. For very
weakly coupled theories, their final size is several times the zero temperature
correlation length. For strongly coupled theories the final size of the domains
is comparable to the zero temperature correlation length and the transition
proceeds faster.
