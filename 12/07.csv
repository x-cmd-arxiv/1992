  1603","Astron.Astrophys.270:102-106,1993",,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations of Sgr A* give strong constraints for possible models of
the physical nature of Sgr A* and suggest the presence of a massive black~hole
with M<2 10^6 M_sun surrounded by an accretion disk which we estimate to
radiate at a luminosity of <7 10^5 L_sun. We therefore calculate the appearance
of a standard accretion disk around a Kerr hole in Sgr A* following from
general relativity and a few fundamental assumptions. Effective temperature and
luminosity of the disk spectra do not depend on the unknown viscosity mechanism
but instead are quite sensitive to variations of intrinsic parameters: the
mass, the accretion rate, the angular momentum of the accreting hole and the
inclination angle. A radiation field of L~7 10^4 - 7 10^5 L_sun and T_eff ~ 2-4
10^4 K can be ascribed to a rapidly rotating Kerr~hole (a>0.9) accreting
10^-8.5 - 10^-7 M_sun/yr at a black~hole mass of M=2 10^6 M_sunseen almost edge
on. A low mass black hole of M<10^3 M_sun seems to be very unlikely. We provide
a ``Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for black holes'' together with simple scaling
laws to provide an easy-to-handle test for the black hole model.

chain driven by the spatio-temporal periodic force $\Gamma sin(\omega t - k_{n}
x)$ with a flat initial condition. For $\Gamma_{c}(n)$ to a translating {\em
2-breather} excitation from a state locked to the driver. For $\omega < k_{n}$,
the excitations of the system are the locked states with the phase velocity
$\omega/k_{n}$ in all the region of $\Gamma$ studied. In the first regime, the
frequency of the breathers is controlled by $\omega$, and the velocity of the
breathers, controlled by $k_{n}$, is shown to be the group velocity determined
from the linear dispersion relation for the sine-Gordon equation. A linear
stability analysis reveals that, in addition to two competing length-scales,
namely, the width of the breathers and the spatial period of the driving, there
is one more length-scale which plays an important role in controlling the
dynamics of the system at small driving. In the second regime the length-scale
$k_{n}$ controls the excitation. The above picture is further corroborated by
numerical nonlinear spectral analysis. An energy balance estimate is also
presented and shown to predict the critical value of $\Gamma$ in good agreement
with the numerics.

investigate the statistics of temperature fluctuations on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB), induced by topological defects. The cases of cosmic strings
and textures are studied. We derive analytically the characteristic function of
the probability distribution for ${\delta T}\over T$ and use it to obtain the
lowest twelve moments including the skewness and the kurtosis. The distribution
function is also obtained and it is compared with the Gaussian distribution
thus identifying long non-Gaussian tails. We show that for both cosmic strings
and textures all odd moments (including skewness) vanish while the relative
deviation from the Gaussian for even moments increases with the order of the
moment. The non-Gaussian signatures of textures, derived from the distribution
function and the moments, are found to be much more prominent than the
corresponding signatures for strings. We discuss the physical origin of this
result.

comprehensively parametrized in terms of higher dimensional effective
operators. After the success of all the recent precission tests on the Standard
Model, we argue that any sensible description of these extensions at the
Z-scale must be stable under higher order quantum corrections. The imposition
of $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariance seems to be the simplest and most
natural way to fulfill this requirement. With this assumption, all the possible
deviations from the standard triple gauge boson vertices can be consistently
parametrized in terms of a finite set of gauge invariant operators. We deal
here with those operators that do not give any tree level effect on present
experimental observables and constrain them by computing their effects at the
one-loop level. We conclude that for a light Higgs boson, the direct
measurement at LEP200 can improve present bounds on these ""blind directions"",
while for a heavy Higgs it is most unlikely to provide any new information.
