waves generated during inflation? The conventional inflationary prediction had
been that the cosmic microwave anisotropy is dominated by energy density
fluctuations generated during inflation and that the gravitational waves
contribute negligibly. In this paper, we report on recent work (in
collaboration with R. Davis, H. Hodges, and M. Turner) that has shown that the
conventional wisdom may be wrong; specifically, gravitational waves may
dominate the anisotropy in inflationary models where the spectrum of
perturbations deviates significantly from scale invariance (e.g., extended and
power-law inflation models and extreme versions of chaotic inflation). If
gravitational waves do dominate at the large-angular scales measured by COBE
DMR, the expectation and interpretation of anisotropies on small-angular scales
is profoundly altered. Invited Paper for Proceedings of the Journees

the trick that is likely to work to all orders in perturbation theory and a

low energy KN potentials for S-wave scattering are also derived. Finally we
consider OGE forces in the related channels K$\Delta$, K$^*$N and K$^*\Delta$,
and determine which have attractive interactions and might therefore exhibit
strong threshold enhancements or ``Z$^*$-molecule"" meson-baryon bound states.
