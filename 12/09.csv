of a flux-line liquid in a slab geometry are described by a hydrodynamic free
energy that incorporates the boundary conditions on the flux lines at the
sample's surface as a surface contribution to the free energy. Bulk and surface
weak disorder are modeled via Gaussian impurity potentials. This free energy is
used to evaluate the two-dimensional structure factor of the flux-line tips at
the sample surface. We find that surface interaction always dominates in
determining the decay of translational correlations in the asymptotic
long-wavelength limit. On the other hand, such large length scales have not
been probed by the decoration experiments. Our results indicate that the
translational correlations extracted from the analysis of the Bitter patterns
are indeed representative of behavior of flux lines in the bulk.

is matter-dominated, $m_\nu<35(23)\times$ max$ [1, (t_0/\tau_\nu)^{1/2}]$ eV,
according as a cosmological constant is (is not) allowed. The best constraints
on the radiative decay of light neutrinos derive from the failure to observe
prompt gamma rays accompanying the neutrinos from Supernova 1987A: For any

moment than that obtained from red giants or white dwarfs. For $m_\nu > 250$ eV

annihilations with $\tau$ decaying into $a_1\nu_\tau \to 3\pi\nu_\tau$. The
$a_1\to 3\pi$ decay is particularly interesting since it (together with $h_1\to
3\pi$) is the lightest hadronic decay in which the helicity of the initial
state can be determined from the distribution of the final particle momenta.
Thus it is the first example of a helicity self-analysing strong decay, as
$\Lambda\to N\pi$ is for weak decays. Apart from providing a new method for
determining the $\tau$ polarization from the parity conserving part in the weak
decay, this reaction provides a very instructive and useful demonstration of
the handedness asymmetry as a measure of parton polarization. Thus we believe
that experience gained from analyses of handedness in $\tau\to 3\pi\nu_\tau$
decay will be very useful when looking for the similar asymmetry of jet
handedness which can measure quark or gluon polarization.
