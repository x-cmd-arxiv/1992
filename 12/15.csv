MSW alone. In this scenario there is a larger region of parameter space
allowed. There is a large strip of parameter space corresponding to adiabatic

can reduce the QCD background at SSC/LHC dramatically. For $E_{6}$ and $SO(10)$

of the QCD vacuum angle. In this model, moments of the inverse squares of the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator obey sum rules, which we conjecture to be
universal. In other words, the validity of the sum rules depends only on the
symmetries of the theory but not on its details. To illustrate this point we
show that the sum rules hold for an interacting liquid of instantons. The
physical interpretation is that the way the thermodynamic limit of the spectral
density near zero is approached is universal. However, its value, $i.e.$ the
chiral condensate, is not.

multicritical points, corresponds to a combination of finite K\""ahler and gauge
transformations. However, those finite gauge transformations are not elements

Gepner models corresponding to tensor products of identical minimal models, the
