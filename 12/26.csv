from gluon condensates in vacuum. Through coherent states of gluons simulating
a mean field type of approximation, we show that the off-shell gluon
condensates of vacuum generate a mass-like contribution for the quarks, giving
rise to chiral symmetry breaking. We next note that spontaneous breaking of
global chiral symmetry links the four component quark field operator to the
pion wave function. This in turn yields many hadronic properties in the light
quark sector in agreement with experiments, leading to the conclusion that low
energy hadron properties are primarily driven by the vacuum structure of
quantum chromodynamics.

requirement that three generations arise from twisted sectors. There exist
supersymmetric vacua realizing the standard model. In one example the anomalous
$U(1)$ breaks the gauge symmetry down to $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_w\times
U(1)_Y\times SO(12)^\prime$.
