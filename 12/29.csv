$\gamma \gamma$ colliders at TeV energy scale.
  The beam polarizations of a $\gamma \gamma$ collider can easily be monitored
by comparing the numbers of events of the processes $\gamma \gamma$
$\rightarrow$ $\ell^+ \ell^-$ and $\gamma \gamma$ $\rightarrow$ $W^+ W^-$,
where $\ell$ means $e$ or $\mu$.
  The luminosity of a $\gamma \gamma$ collider is also measurable by the event
rate of $W$ boson pair productions and the light lepton pair productions.

given generically, and the exact solution is obtained explicitly. In
particular, the set of all lattice topological field theories is shown to be in
one-to-one correspondence with the set of all associative algebras $R$, and the
physical Hilbert space is identified with the center $Z(R)$ of the associative
algebra $R$. Perturbations of TFT's are also considered in this approach,
showing that the form of topological perturbations is automatically determined,
and that all TFT's are obtained from one TFT by such perturbations. Several
examples are presented, including twisted $N=2$ minimal topological matter and
the case where $R$ is a group ring.

Dissociation(ED) cross sections and the predictions of the semiclassical
Weiz\""acker-Williams-Fermi(WWF) method. In this paper, the validity of the
semiclassical approximation is examined. The total cross section for
electromagnetic excitation of a nuclear target by a spinless projectile is
calculated in first Born approximation, neglecting recoil. The final result is
expressed in terms of correlation functions and convoluted densities in
configuration space. The result agrees with the WWF approximation to leading
order(unretarded electric dipole approximation), but the method allows an
analytic evaluation of the cutoff, which is determined by the details of the
electric dipole transition charge density. Using the Goldhaber-Teller model of
that density, and uniform charge densities for both projectile and target, the
cutoff is determined for the total cross section in the nonrelativistic limit,
and found to be smaller than values currently used for ED calculations. In
addition, cross sections are calculated using a phenomenological momentum space
cutoff designed to model final state interactions. For moderate projectile
energies, the calculated ED cross section is found to be smaller than the
semiclassical result, in qualitative agreement with experiment.
