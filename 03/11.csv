induced by flux tube confinement, concentrating first on the simplest
possibility---one which requires no new physics beyond the standard model.
Monopoles existing at the time of the electroweak phase transition may trigger
$W$ condensation which can confine magnetic flux into flux tubes. However we
show on very general grounds, using several independent estimates, that such a
mechanism is impotent. We then present several general dynamical arguments
constraining the possibility of monopole annihilation through any confining
phase near the electroweak scale.

the lowest temperature ($T_{em} \approx 10^6 GeV$) consistent with not having
the monopoles dominate the energy density of the universe.

  Term","27 pages","Phys.Rev. D46 (1992) 1737-1749","10.1103/PhysRevD.46.1737",,"hep-th",,"  We discuss the canonical quantization of Quantum Electrodynamics in $2+1$
dimensions, with a Chern-Simons topological mass term and gauge-covariant
coupling to a Dirac spinor field. A gauge-fixing term is used which generates a
canonical momentum for $A_0$, so that there are no primary constraints on
operator-valued fields. Gauss's Law and the gauge condition, $A_0=0$, are
implemented by embedding the formulation in an appropriate physical subspace,
in which state vectors remain naturally, in the course of time evolution. The
photon propagator is derived from the canonical theory. The electric and
magnetic fields are separated into parts that reflect the presence of massive
photons, and other parts that are rigidly attached to charged fermions and do
not consist of any observable, propagating particle excitations. The effect of
rotations on charged particle states is analyzed, and the relation between the
canonical and the Belinfante ``symmetric'' angular momentum is discussed. It is
shown that the rotation operator can be consistently formulated so that charged
particles behave like fermions, and do not acquire any arbitrary phases during
rotations, even when they are dressed in the electromagnetic fields required
for them to obey Gauss's law.

B384 (1992) 459-483","10.1016/0550-3213(92)90576-W",,"hep-th",,"  We exhibit the multicritical phase structure of the loop gas model on a
random surface. The dense phase is reconsidered, with special attention paid to
the topological points $g=1/p$. This phase is complementary to the dilute and
higher multicritical phases in the sense that dense models contain the same
spectrum of bulk operators (found in the continuum by Lian and Zuckerman) but a
different set of boundary operators. This difference illuminates the well-known
$(p,q)$ asymmetry of the matrix chain models. Higher multicritical phases are
constructed, generalizing both Kazakov's multicritical models as well as the
known dilute phase models. They are quite likely related to multicritical
polymer theories recently considered independently by Saleur and Zamolodchikov.
Our results may be of help in defining such models on {\it flat} honeycomb
lattices; an unsolved problem in polymer theory. The phase boundaries
correspond again to ``topological'' points with $g=p/1$ integer, which we study
in some detail. Two qualitatively different types of critical points are
discovered for each such $g$. For the special point $g=2$ we demonstrate that
the dilute phase $O(-2)$ model does {\it not} correspond to the Parisi-Sourlas
model, a result likely to hold as well for the flat case. Instead it is proven
that the first {\it multicritical} $O(-2)$ point possesses the Parisi-Sourlas
supersymmetry.}
