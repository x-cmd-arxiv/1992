B391 (1993) 651-674","10.1016/0550-3213(93)90087-6",,"hep-th",,"  The depth rule is a level truncation of tensor product coefficients expected
to be sufficient for the evaluation of fusion coefficients. We reformulate the
depth rule in a precise way, and show how, in principle, it can be used to
calculate fusion coefficients. However, we argue that the computation of the
depth itself, in terms of which the constraints on tensor product coefficients
is formulated, is problematic. Indeed, the elements of the basis of states
convenient for calculating tensor product coefficients do not have a
well-defined depth! We proceed by showing how one can calculate the depth in an
`approximate' way and derive accurate lower bounds for the minimum level at
which a coupling appears. It turns out that this method yields exact results
for $\widehat{su}(3)$ and constitutes an efficient and simple algorithm for
computing $\widehat{su}(3)$ fusion coefficients.

describe its connection to the (big cell of the) Sato Grassmannian $\Gr$ via
the Plucker embedding of $\Gr$ into a fermionic Fock space. Then the space of
solutions to the string equation is an explicitly computable subspace of
$\Gr\times\Gr$ which is invariant under the flows.

written in terms of $SO(3)$ gauge fields and gives Ashtekar's constraints for
Einstein gravity. However, it does not depend on the space-time metric nor its
signature explicitly. We discuss how the space-time metric is introduced from
algebraic relations of the constraints and the Hamiltonian by focusing our
attention on the signature factor. The system describes both Euclidian and
Lorentzian metrics depending on reality assignments of the gauge connections.
That is, Euclidian metrics arise from the real gauge fields. On the other hand,
self-duality of the gauge fields, which is well known in the Ashtekar's
formalism, is also derived in this theory from consistency condition of
Lorentzian metric. We also show that the metric so determined is equivalent to
that given by Urbantke, which is usually accepted as a definition of the metric
for this system.

exactly equivalent to the O(3) $\sigma$ model with the Hopf term. We impose the
$CP_1$ constraint by using the gaussian representation of the delta function.
For the coefficient of the Hopf term, $\theta = {\pi \over 2s}$, 2s being an
integer, we show that the resulting model is exactly equivalent to an
interacting theory of spin-$s$ fields. Thus we conjecture that there should be
a fixed point in the spin-$s$ theory near which it is exactly equal to the
$\sigma$ model.
