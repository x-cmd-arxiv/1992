on a line can be formulated as a gauge invariant theory based on the Poincar\'e
group with central extension -- a formulation that complements and simplifies
H.~Verlinde's construction based on the unextended Poincar\'e group.

symmetric) blackholes in interaction with various classical matter fields (such
as electromagnetic fields, dilaton fields, axion fields, Abelian Higgs fields,
non--Abelian gauge fields, {\sl etc}). A common feature of these investigations
that has not previously been remarked upon is that the Hawking temperature of
such systems appears to be suppressed relative to that of a vacuum blackhole of
equal horizon area. That is: $k T_H \leq \hbar/(4\pi r_H) \equiv
\hbar/\sqrt{4\pi A_H}$. This paper will argue that this suppression is generic.
Specifically, it will be shown that
  \[ k T_H = {\hbar\over4\pi r_H} \; e^{-\phi(r_H)} \;
  \left( 1 - 8\pi G \; \rho_H \; r_H^2 \right). \]
  Here $\phi(r_H)$ is an integral quantity, depending on the distribution of
matter, that is guaranteed to be positive if the Weak Energy Condition is
satisfied. Several examples of this behaviour will be discussed.
Generalizations of this behaviour to non--symmetric non--static blackholes are
conjectured.

theory, it is necessary to introduce contact interactions when vertex operators
collide. Otherwise, certain superconformal Ward identities would be violated.
In this note, we show how these contact terms arise naturally when proper
account is taken of the superconformal geometry involved when punctures
collide. More precisely, we show that there is no contact term at all! Rather,
corrections arise to the ``na\""\i ve"" formula when the boundary of moduli space
is described correctly.

dynamics of black hole formation and evaporation without abandoning unitary
evolution. Previous efforts to resolve this puzzle assume that information
escapes in corrections to the Hawking process, that an arbitrarily large amount
of information is transmitted by a planckian energy or contained in a
Planck-sized remnant, or that the information is lost to another universe. Each
of these possibilities has serious difficulties. This paper considers another
alternative: remnants that carry large amounts of information and whose size
and mass depend on their information content. The existence of such objects is
suggested by attempts to incorporate a Planck scale cutoff into physics. They
would greatly alter the late stages of the evaporation process. The main
drawback of this scenario is apparent acausal behavior behind the horizon.
