of gauge fields, the theory of formation of critical and subcritical bubbles

cosmological models with flat closed spatial surfaces in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetime
dimensions. The metric ansatz is kept in its most general form compatible with
Hamiltonian minisuperspace dynamics. Nontrivial theta-sectors admitting a
semiclassical no-boundary wave function are shown to exist only in 3+1
dimensions, and there only for two spatial topologies. In both cases the
spatial surface is nonorientable and the nontrivial no-boundary theta-sector
unique. In 2+1 dimensions the nonexistence of nontrivial no-boundary
theta-sectors is shown to be of topological origin and thus to transcend both
the semiclassical approximation and the minisuperspace ansatz. Relation to the
necessary condition given by Hartle and Witt for the existence of no-boundary
theta-states is discussed.

broken down to a subalgebra in any spacetime background. For given toroidal
backgrounds, the unbroken gauge symmetries (corresponding to holomorphic and
antiholomorphic worldsheet currents) generate area-preserving diffeomorphism
algebras of null 2-tori. A minimal Lie algebraic closure containing all the
gauge symmetries that arise in this way, is the background--independent
volume--preserving diffeomorphism algebra of the target Narain torus $T^{4,4}$.
The underlying symmetries act on the ground ring of functions on $T^{4,4}$ as
derivations, much as in the case of the $d=2$ string. A background--independent
spacetime action valid for noncompact metrics is presented, whose symmetries
are volume--preserving diffeomorphisms. Possible extensions to $N=2$ and $N=1$
heterotic strings are briefly discussed.

($3g-2$ for the partition function). We present the explicit results for the
partition function and the one-loop correlator in genus one. We compare the

$c=1$ CFT and show an agreement of the one-loop correlators for genus zero.
