(two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to $c \leq 1$ conformal field
theories) are obtained using the continuum Liouville field approach. The
structure of momentum singularities is different from that of sphere amplitudes
and is more complicated. It can be understood by factorizations of the
amplitudes with the tachyon and the discrete states as intermediate states.

obtain, in particular a non trivial implementation of crossing-symmetry,
interesting connections between the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitudes, the
possibility of introducing generalized statistics, and the monodromy properties
of the OPE of the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory.
