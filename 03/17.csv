that models of spontaneous CP violation can in principle avoid the domain wall
problem first pointed out by Zel'dovich, Kobzarev and Okun. A small but nonzero
$\theta_{QCD}$ explicitly breaks CP and can lift the degeneracy of the two CP
conjugate vacua through nonperturbative effects so that the domain walls become
unstable, but survive to cosmologically interesting epochs. We explore the
viability of spontaneous CP violation in the context of two Higgs models, and
find that the invisible axion solution of the strong CP problem cannot be
implemented without further extensions of the Higgs sector.

density inhomogeneities due to strings, global monopoles, textures and other
topological and non-topological defects. Neither of these models leads to a
consistent cosmological theory without the help of inflation. However, each of
these models can be incorporated into inflationary cosmology. We propose a
model of inflationary phase transitions, which, in addition to topological and
non-topological defects, may provide adiabatic density perturbations with a
sharp maximum between the galaxy scale $l_g$ and the horizon scale $l_H$.

systems in the presence of a BLACK HOLE which may be regarded as describing a
string propagating in target space with a black-hole metric. These theories are
associated with non-canonical $\bf Z$-gradations of simple algebras, where the
gradation-zero subgroup is non-abelian. They correspond to gauged WZNW models
where the gauge group is nilpotent and are thus basically different from the
ones currently considered following Witten. The non-abelian Toda potential
gives a cosmological term which may be exactly integrated at the classical
level.

B393 (1993) 547-570","10.1016/0550-3213(93)90073-X",,"hep-th",,"  We study the effect of a Chern-Simons term in a theory with discrete gauge
group H, which in (2+1)-dimensional space time describes (non-abelian) anyons.
As in a previous paper, we emphasize the underlying algebraic structure, namely
the Hopf algebra D(H). We argue on physical grounds that the addition of a
Chern-Simons term in the action leads to a non-trivial 3-cocycle on D(H).
Accordingly, the physically inequivalent models are labelled by the elements of
the cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). It depends periodically on the coefficient of
the Chern-Simons term which model is realized. This establishes a relation with
the discrete topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Witten. Some
representative examples are worked out explicitly.
