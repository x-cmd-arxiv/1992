maximally extended Schwarzschild-like geometry, two asymptotically flat
spacetime domains. One can get rid of the second domain by gauging the discrete
symmetry on the SL(2,R)/U(1) coset that interchanges the two asymptotic domains
and preserves the Kruskal time orientation everywhere in the Kruskal plane.
Here it is shown that upon performing this orbifold procedure, we obtain a
theory of unoriented open and closed strings in a black hole background, with
just one asymptotically flat domain and a time-like orbifold singularity at the
origin. All of the open string states of the model are confined to the orbifold
singularity. We also discuss various physical aspects of the truncated black
hole, in particular its target duality -- the model is dual to a conventional
open string theory in the black hole geometry.

role in an Einstein-Maxwell theory whose Weyl tensor is selfdual and whose
Maxwell tensor has algebraically general anti-selfdual part. This model was
first introduced by Flaherty and recently studied by Park as an integrable
deformation of selfdual gravity. A twisted volume form on the corresponding
twistor space is shown to be the origin of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms.
An immediate consequence is the existence of an infinite number of symmetries
as a generalization of $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in selfdual gravity. A
possible relation to Witten's 2D string theory is pointed out.

"math/9203203","Elise E. Cawley","Elise E. Cawley","The Teichm\""uller space of the standard action of $SL(2,Z)$ on $T^2$ is
  trivial",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1992/4","math.DS",,"  The group $SL(n,{\bf Z})$ acts linearly on $\R^n$, preserving the integer
lattice $\Z^{n} \subset \R^{n}$. The induced (left) action on the n-torus
$\T^{n} = \R^{n}/\Z^{n}$ will be referred to as the ``standard action''.
  It has recently been shown that the standard action of $SL(n,\Z)$ on $\T^n$,
for $n \geq 3$, is both topologically and smoothly rigid. That is, nearby
actions in the space of representations of $SL(n,\Z)$ into ${\rm
Diff}^{+}(\T^{n})$ are smoothly conjugate to the standard action. In fact, this
rigidity persists for the standard action of a subgroup of finite index. On the
other hand, while the $\Z$ action on $\T^{n}$ defined by a single hyperbolic
element of $SL(n,\Z)$ is topologically rigid, an infinite dimensional space of
smooth conjugacy classes occur in a neighborhood of the linear action.
  The standard action of $SL(2, \Z)$ on $\T^2$ forms an intermediate case, with
different rigidity properties from either extreme. One can construct continuous
deformations of the standard action to obtain an (arbritrarily near) action to
which it is not topologically conjugate. The purpose of the present paper is to
show that if a nearby action, or more generally, an action with some mild
Anosov properties, is conjugate to the standard action of $SL(2, \Z)$ on $\T^2$
by a homeomorphism $h$, then $h$ is smooth. In fact, it will be shown that this
rigidity holds for any non-cyclic subgroup of $SL(2, \Z)$.
