cohomology groups $H^p_{\acute{e}t}(X,G_m)$ in degrees $p=0$, $1$ and $2$ of a
toric variety $X$ with coefficients in the sheaf of units. The method is to
reduce the computation down to the problem of diagonalizing a matrix with
integral coefficients. The procedure outlined in this article has been fully
implemented by the author as a program written in the ``C'' programming

constant B neutrino flux reduction is ruled out at greater than the 4$\sigma$
level for both data sets. While such a flux reduction provides a marginal fit
to the unweighted averages of the concurrent data, it does not provide a good
fit to the average of the full 20 year sample. Gallium experiments may not be
able to distinguish between the currently allowed neutrino-based possibilities.

quantum gravity have been found in the loop representation, which is based on
Ashtekar's new variables. While the diffeomorphism constraint is easily solved
by considering loop functionals which are knot invariants, there remains the
puzzle why several of the known knot invariants are also solutions to the
hamiltonian constraint. We show how the Jones polynomial gives rise to an
infinite set of solutions to all the constraints of quantum gravity thereby
illuminating the structure of the space of solutions and suggesting the
existance of a deep connection between quantum gravity and knot theory at a
dynamical level.

"hep-th/9203041",,"Julian Barbour and Lee Smolin","Extremal variety as the foundation of a cosmological quantum theory","32 pages, 19 Figures, not included",,,,"hep-th",,"  Dynamical systems of a new kind are described, which are motivated by the
problem of constructing diffeomorphism invariant quantum theories. These are
based on the extremization of a non-local and non-additive quantity that we
call the variety of a system. In these systems all dynaqmical variables refer
to relative coordinates or, more generally, describe relations between
particles, so that they are invariant under discrete analogues of
diffeomorphisms in which the labels of all particles are permutted arbitrarily.
The variety is a measures of how uniquely each of the elements of the system
can be distinguished from the others in terms of the values of these relative
coordinates. Thus a system with extremal variety is one in which the parts are
related to the whole in as distinct a way as possible.
  We study numerically several dynamical systems which are defined by setting
the action of the system equal to its variety. We find evidence that suggests
that such systems may serve as the basis for a new kind of pregeometry theories
in which the geometry of low dimensional space emerges in the thermodynamic
limit from a system which is defined without the use of any background space.
  The mathematical definition of variety may also provide a quantitative tool
to study self-organizing systems, because it distinguishes highly structured,
but asymmetric, configurations such as one finds in biological systems from
both random configurations and highly ordered configurations.

also argued that the most generally used measure, i.e., the covariant

only physical variables contribute and that its path integral fails to keep the
cancellation of contributions between the Faddeev-Popov ghosts and the
unphysical variables of the linearized gravitational field, although it has a
coordinate invariant measure. In de~Sitter spacetime, it is shown that the
uncancellation factor can be understood as a nontrivial (anomalous) Jacobian
factor under the transformation of the path-integral measure from covariant one
