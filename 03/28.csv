  compressed files, uuencoded, (submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett.)",,,,"cond-mat",,"  We contrast analytical results of a variety of growth models involving
subdiffusion, thermal noise and quenched disorder with simulations of these
models, concluding that the assumed self-affinity property is more an exception
than a rule. In our two dimensional models, self-affine surfaces may only
appear when the roughness exponent is $\chi = 1/2$ or $\chi = 1$. A new scaling
picture, which leads to more suitable ways of determining the scaling
exponents, is proposed when lack of self-affinity exists.

$SL(2,R)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. It is shown explicitly that the resulting
background fields satisfy the field equations of the three dimensional string
effective action and the target space has curvature singularity. Close
connection of our solution with the three dimensional black string is
demonstrated.
