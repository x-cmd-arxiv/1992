with a singular locus of dimension $k$ and good behavior at infinity is
described using generic pencils. This is analogous to the van Kampen procedure
for finding a fundamental group of a plane curve. In addition we use a certain
representation generalizing the Burau representation of the braid group. A
divisibility theorem is proven that shows the dependence of this homotopy group
on the local type of singularities and behavior at infinity. Examples are given
showing that this group depends on certain global data in addition to local
data on singularities.

involving real (beamstrahlung or backscattered laser) or quasi--real
(bremsstrahlung) photons in the initial state and hadrons in the final state.
The production of two central jets with large pT is described in some detail;
we give distributions for the rapidity and pT of the jets as well as the
di--jet invariant mass, and discuss the relative importance of various initial
state configurations and the uncertainties in our predictions. We also present
results for `mono--jet' production where one jet goes down a beam pipe, for the
production of charm, bottom and top quarks, and for single production of W and
Z bosons. Where appropriate, the two--photon processes are compared with
annihilation reactions leading to similar final states. We also argue that the
behaviour of the total inelastic gamma-gamma cross section at high energies
will probably have little impact on the severity of background problems caused
by soft and semi--hard (`minijet') two--photon reactions. We find very large
differences in cross sections for all two--photon processes between existing
designs for future e+e- colliders, due to the different beamstrahlung spectra;
in particular, both designs with <<1 and >>1 events per bunch crossing exist.

turns out that independently of whether the 2d QFT is conformal the operator
products of twist operators are non-singular, suggesting that massive
(non-conformal) orbifolds also `resolve singularities' just as in the conformal
case. Moreover we recover the OPE of twist operators for conformal theories by
considering the UV limit of the massive orbifold correlation functions.
Alternatively, we can use the OPE of twist fields at the conformal point to
derive conditions for the existence of non-singular solutions to special
non-linear differential equations (such as Painleve III).

Since QCD strings can be identified with a BF theory, we are able to show a

Furthermore, we observe that when 4D gravitation is cast into a BF form through
the use of Ashtekar variables, we are able to get order $\hbar$ contributions
to gravity which can be associated with the $W_2$ anomaly. We comment on the
relationship to gravitational monopoles.

field theory point of view started in \cite{RS91}.
  We first discuss in details $S$ and $T$ matrices for the $U(1,1)$ super WZW
model and obtain, for the level $k$ an integer, new finite dimensional
representations of the modular group. These have the remarkable property that
some of the $S$ matrix elements are infinite. Moreover, typical and atypical
representations as well as indecomposable blocks are mixed: truncation to
maximally atypical representations, as advocated in some recent papers, is not
consistent.
  The main topological application of this work is the computation of Alexander
invariants for 3-manifolds and for links in 3-manifolds. Invariants of
3-manifolds seem to depend trivially on the level $k$, but still contain
interesting topological information. For Seifert manifolds for instance, they
coincide with the order of the first homology group. Examples of invariants of
links in 3-manifolds are given. They exhibit interesting arithmetic properties.
