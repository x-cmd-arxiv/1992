"hep-ph/9203205",,"Oscar F. Hernandez","Extended Color Models with a Heavy Top Quark","8 pages",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We present a class of models in which the top quark, by mixing with new
physics at a higher energy scale, is naturally heavier than the other standard
model particles. We take this new physics to be extended color. Our models
contain new particles with masses between 100 GeV and 1 TeV, some of which may
be just within the reach of the next generation of experiments. In particular
one of our models implies the existence of two right handed top quarks. These
models demonstrate the existence of a standard model-like theory consistent
with experiment, and leading to new physics below the TeV scale, in which the
third generation is treated differently than the first two.

realisations, which involve only one energy-momentum tensor. Since realisations
of non-linear algebras are not easy to come by, the fact that this new class
exists is of intrinsic interest. We use these new realisations to build the
corresponding $W$-string theories and show that they are effectively described
by two independent ordinary Virasoro-like strings.

describe a set of algorithms which constitute the basis for a computer program

superpotential of all possible models within the class we consider. Our search
through the huge parameter space to be explored is simplified considerably by
the constraint of $N=1$ spacetime supersymmetry and the need for extra $Q,\bar
Q$ representations beyond the standard ones in order to possibly achieve string
gauge coupling unification at scales of ${\cal O}(10^{18}\GeV)$. Our results
are remarkably simple and evidence the large degree of redundancy in this kind
of constructions. We find one model with gauge group $SU(5)\times
U(1)_\ty\times SO(10)_h\times SU(4)_h\times U(1)^5$ and fairly acceptable
phenomenological properties. We study the $D$- and $F$-flatness constraints and
the symmetry breaking pattern in this model and conclude that string gauge
coupling unification is quite possible.
