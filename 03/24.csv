the second Hamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy, I construct a
bi-Hamiltonian hierarchy for the two associated currents. The KP hierarchy
appears as a composite of this new and simpler system. The bi-Hamiltonian
structure of the new hierarchy gives naturally all the Hamiltonian structures
of the KP system.

crossing-invariant models solvable by Bethe Ansatz. In the case of the XXZ
Heisemberg chain we derive, for arbitrary values of the anysotropy, a {\bf
single} non--linear integral equation from which the free energy can be exactly
calculated. The high--temperature expansion follows in a sistematic and
relatively simple way. For low temperatures we obtain the correct central
charge and predict the analytic structure of the full expansion around $T=0$.
Furthermore, we derive a single non-linear integral equation describing the
finite--size ground--state energy of the Sine--Gordon quantum field theory.

conditions by disentangling the type II representations of $SU(2)_q$, at
$q=e^{i\pi/p}$, from the full SOS spectrum obtained through Algebraic Bethe
Ansatz. The rule which realizes the quantum group reduction to the RSOS states
is that there must not be {\it singular} roots in the solutions of the Bethe
Ansatz equations describing the states with quantum spin $J<(p-1)/2$. By
studying how this rule is active on the particle states, we are able to give a
microscopic derivation of the lattice $S-$matrix of the massive kinks. The
correspondence between the light--cone Six--Vertex model and the Sine--Gordon
field theory implies that the continuum limit of the RSOS($p+1$) model is to be
identified with the $p-$restricted Sine--Gordon field theory.
