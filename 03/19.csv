gauge-boson couplings, both at tree-level and in loop-induced processes, have
been criticized on the grounds that the lagrangians employed are not \gwk gauge
invariant. We prove that, in fact, the general Lorentz-invariant and $U(1)_\em$
invariant but {\it not} $SU_L(2)\times U_Y(1)$ invariant action is equivalent
to the general lagrangian in which $SU_L(2)\times U_Y(1)$ appears but is
nonlinearly realized. We demonstrate this equivalence in an explicit
calculation, and show how it is reconciled with loop calculations in which the
different formulations can (superficially) appear to give different answers. In
this sense any effective theory containing light spin-one particles is seen to
be automatically gauge invariant.

effective lagrangians in the literature to constrain new physics and to
determine the `physics reach' of future experiments. We demonstrate that many
calculations, such as those involving anomalous trilinear gauge-boson
couplings, either considerably overestimate loop-induced effects, or give
ambiguous answers. The source of these problems is the use of cutoffs to
evaluate the size of such operators in loop diagrams. In contrast to other
critics of these loop estimates, we prove that the inclusion of
nonlinearly-realized gauge invariance into the low-energy lagrangian is
irrelevant to this conclusion. We use an explicit example using known
multi-Higgs physics above the weak scale to underline these points. We show how
to draw conclusions regarding the nature of the unknown high-energy physics
without making reference to low-energy cutoffs.

are canceled to all orders in perturbation theory. The resulting Monte Carlo

is manifestly invariant under both the target-space super-Poincar\'e group and
the world-line local $N=8$ superconformal group. This twistor-like construction
naturally involves the sphere $S^8$ as a coset space of the $D=10$ Lorentz
group. The action contains only a finite set of auxiliary fields, but they
appear in unusual trilinear combinations. The origin of the on-shell $D=10$
fermionic $\kappa$ symmetry of the standard Brink-Schwarz formulation is
explained. The coupling to a $D=10$ super-Maxwell background requires a new
mechanism, in which the electric charge appears only on shell as an integration
constant.

dimensional model theory that allows one to consider black hole evaporation in
the semi-classical approximation. They originally hoped the black hole would
evaporate completely without a singularity. However, it has been shown that the
semi-classical equations will give a singularity where the dilaton field
reaches a certain critical value. Initially, it seems this singularity will be
hidden inside a black hole. However, as the evaporation proceeds, the dilaton
field on the horizon will approach the critical value but the temperature and
rate of emission will remain finite. These results indicate either that there
is a naked singularity, or (more likely) that the semi-classical approximation
breaks down when the dilaton field approaches the critical value.
