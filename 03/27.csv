forms from the supersymmetric grand unified scale, DHR obtained predictions for
the quark masses and mixings. Using Monte Carlo methods we test these
predictions against the latest determinations of the mixings, the CP-violating
parameter epsilon_K and the B_d^0--Bbar_d^0 mixing parameter r_d. The
acceptable solutions closely specify the quark masses and mixings, but lie at
the edges of allowed regions at 90% confidence level.

improved by perturbatively eliminating effects proportional to the lattice
spacing. In this paper, we apply this improvement program to the heavy quark
effective theory currents which cause a heavy quark to decay to a light quark,
and renormalize the resulting operators to order $\alphaS$. We find a small
decrease in the amount that the operator needs to be renormalized, relative to
the unimproved case.

$\Gamma_{cusp}(\vartheta, \alpha_\s)$ determines the infrared behaviour of the
on-shell quark form factor, the velocity-dependent anomalous dimension in the
heavy quark effective field theory (HQET) and the renormalization properties of
the vacuum averaged Wilson lines with a cusp. It is demonstrated that a
combined use of the methods developed in the relevant different branches of
quantum field theory essentially facilitates the all-order study of the
asymptotic and analytic properties of this function.

version) in a strong-coupling regime. Infinitely many bound states are found
together with the corresponding S-matrices. These new solutions of the
Yang-Baxter eqations are related to some reducible representations of the
quantum $sl(2)$ algebra resembling the Kac-Moody algebra representations in the
Wess-Zumino-Witten-Novikov conformal field theory.
