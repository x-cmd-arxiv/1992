curves and integrable systems is discovered. The action of maximal commutative
subalgebras of the formal loop algebra of GL(n) defined on certain
infinite-dimensional Grassmannians is studied. It is proved that every
finite-dimensional orbit of the action of traceless elements of these
commutative Lie algebras is isomorphic to the Prym variety associated with a
morphism of algebraic curves. Conversely, it is shown that every Prym variety
can be realized as a finite-dimensional orbit of the action of traceless
diagonal elements of the formal loop algebra, which defines the multicomponent
KP system.

study of the geometry of the moduli space of stable bundles on a smooth
projective curve defined over an algebraically closed field $k$, of arbitrary
characteristic. This establishes a bridge between the arithmetic approach of
Harder, Narasimhan et al. and the gauge group approach of Atiyah and Bott. One
of the basic ideas is to consider a notion of divisor of higher rank and a
suitable Abel-Jacobi map generalizing the classical notions in rank one.

"hep-ph/9203218",,"Markus A. Luty","Electroweak Symmetry Breaking via a Technicolor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
  Model","(27 pages)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We consider a theory of gauge fields and fermions which we argue gives rise
to dynamics similar to that of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model when a gauge
coupling constant is appropriately fine-tuned. We discuss the application of
this model to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by a top-quark
condensate. In this model, custodial symmetry is violated solely by
perturbatively weak interactions, and the top--bottom mass splitting is due to
the enhanced sensitivity to custodial symmetry violation near the critical
point. We also consider models in which electroweak symmetry is broken by new
strongly- interacting fermions with NJL-like dynamics. We argue that these
models require additional fine-tuning in order to keep corrections to the
electroweak $\rho$-parameter acceptably small.

context of 1+1 dimensional gravity. The semi-classical equations of Callan,
Giddings, Harvey and Strominger provide a consistent description of the
evaporation process which we describe in detail. We consider the possibility
that black hole evolution leads to massive stable remnants. We show that such
zero temperature remnant solutions exist but we also prove that a decaying
black hole cannot evolve into one of them. Finally we consider the issue of
loss of quantum information behind the global event horizon which develops in
these geometries. An analogy with a well known solvable system shows that there
may be less to information than meets the eye.
