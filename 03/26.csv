argue that two-dimensional supersymmetric sigma models with (4,0) supersymmetry
are finite. This result is confirmed up to three loop order in pertubation
theory by an explicit calculation using (1,0) superfields. In particular, it is
shown that the finite counterterms which must be introduced into the theory in
order to maintain (4,0) supersymmetry are precisely the terms that are required
to establish ultra-violet finiteness.

the case of the heterotic string compactified on a symmetric orbifold, for
untwisted moduli, extending previous analysis on gauge couplings. Like in the
gauge case, the contribution comes entirely from the spacetime $N=2$ sector. As
a byproduct, this calculation provides a simple derivation of the trace anomaly
coefficients for the different fields coupled to gravity.

metrics and the Kantowski-Sachs minisuperspace contained in it. We discuss the
quantization of the midisuperspace using the fact that the dimensionally
reduced Einstein Hilbert action becomes a scalar-tensor theory of gravity in
two dimensions. We show that the covariant regularization procedure in the
midisuperspace induces modifications into the minisuperspace Wheeler DeWitt
equation.
