Lagrangian. Interactions of the heavy hadrons with light octet Goldstone bosons
are studied in a framework which represents a synthesis of chiral perturbation
theory and the heavy quark effective theory. The differential decay rate for
the semileptonic process $\LBzero \to \Sigma_c^{++} + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e +
\pi^-$ is calculated at the zero recoil point using this hybrid formalism.

to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Under this generalized action, we attempt to
explain i) the flat rotation curves observed in spiral galaxies, which is
usually attributed to the existence of dark matter, and ii) the contradicting
observations of uniform cosmic microwave background and non-uniform galaxy
distributions against redshift. For the former, we attain the flatness of
velocities, although the magnitudes remain about half of the observations. For
the latter, we obtain a solution with oscillating Hubble parameter under
uniform mass distributions. This solution leads to several peaks of galaxy
number counts as a function of redshift with the first peak corresponding to
the Great Wall.

nonperturbative quantum gravity are obtained using the recently introduced loop
variables. It is shown that: i) While local operators such as the metric at a
point may not be well-defined, there do exist {\it non-local} operators, such
as the area of a given 2-surface, which can be regulated diffeomorphism
invariantly and which are finite {\it without} renormalization; ii)there exist
quantum states which approximate a given flat geometry at large scales, but
such states exhibit a discrete structure at the Planck scale; iii) these
results are tied together by the fact that the spectra of the operators that
measure the areas of surfaces are quantized in integral units of the Planck
area.

self-duality} conditions, that have been developed in our previous paper on the
Yang-Mills and supergravity backgrounds. Remarkably, the Majorana-Weyl spinor
dictating the {\it supersymmetric self-duality} conditions is consistent with
the couplings of Green-Schwarz superstring. Such Green-Schwarz superstring is
supposed to be the underlying theory of the {\it supersymmetric self-dual}
Yang-Mills theory, which is conjectured to generate {\it all} exactly soluble
supersymmetric systems in lower dimensions.

topological field theory due to H. and E. Verlinde. This comparison clarifies
these previous results, as it is seen that the amplitude arises purely from a
linearised gravitational interaction. The interpretation of poles in the
