and the Clifford dimension on linearly equivalent smooth curves on Enriques
surfaces. The method is similar to techniques of M.Green $\&$ R.Lazarsfeld and
G.Pareschi.

and then give fusion rules for these representations. We also consider the
problem of $\cR$-matrices, intertwiners of the differently ordered tensor
products of these representations, and satisfying altogether Yang--Baxter
equations.

theory provide an infinite set of conserved (gauge) quantum numbers ($W$-hair)
which characterise black hole states and maintain quantum coherence. Here we
study ways of measuring the $W$-hair of spherically-symmetric four-dimensional
objects with event horizons, treated as effectively two-dimensional string
black holes. Measurements can be done either through the s-wave scattering of
light particles off the string black-hole background, or through interference
experiments of Aharonov-Bohm type. In the first type of measurement, selection
