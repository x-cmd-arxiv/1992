neutrino and by the solar neutrino problem, we construct a class of models
which contain in their low-energy spectrum a single light sterile neutrino and
one or more Nambu-Goldstone bosons. In these models the required pattern of
breaking of lepton-number symmetry takes place near the electroweak scale and
all mass heirarchies are technically natural. The models are compatible with
all cosmological and astrophysical constraints, and can solve the solar
neutrino problem via either the MSW effect or vacuum oscillations. The deficit
in atmospheric muon neutrinos seen in the Kamiokande and IMB detectors can also
be explained in these models.

  $e^+e^-$ colliders","44 pages",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The motivations for low-energy supersymmetry and the main features of the
minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model are reviewed. Possible
non-minimal models and the issue of gauge coupling unification are also
discussed. Theoretical results relevant for supersymmetric particle searches at
present and future accelerators are presented, with emphasis on the role of a
proposed $\epem$ collider with $\sqrt{s}
  = 500 \gev$. In particular, recent results on radiative corrections to
supersymmetric Higgs boson masses and couplings are summarized, and their
implications for experimental searches are discussed in some detail. (Plenary

distinguished by its coldness (vanishing Hawking temperature) and its
supersymmetry. We examine RN solutions to Einstein-Maxwell theory with a
cosmological constant $\Lambda$, classifying the cold black holes and, for
positive $\Lambda$, the ``lukewarm"" black holes at the same temperature as the
de Sitter thermal background. For negative $\Lambda$, we classify the
supersymmetric solutions within the context of $N=2$ gauged supergravity. One
finds supersymmetric analogues of flat-space extreme RN black holes, which for
nonzero $\Lambda$ differ from the cold black holes. In addition, there is an
exotic class of supersymmetric solutions which cannot be continued to flat
space, since the magnetic charge becomes infinite in that limit.

allow for fluctuations of an intrinsic worldsheet metric through a dynamical

results of hermitian matrix models to all orders in the genus expansion. For
the compact $c=1$ case the vortices are Wilson lines, whose exclusion leads to
the theory of non-interacting fermions. As a by-product of the analysis one
finds the critical behaviour of SOS and vertex models coupled to 2D quantum
gravity.

anomalies, we construct covariant BRST and ghost number supercurrents in the
effective theory. We then show that the (super-)coordinate BRST current algebra
forms a superfield extension of the topological conformal algebra for an {\it
arbitrary\/} type of conformal matter or, in terms of the string theory, for an
arbitrary number of space-time dimensions. This fact is very contrast with
$N=0$ and $N=1$ (super-)Liouville theory, where the topological algebra singles
out a particular value of dimensions. Our observation suggests a topological
nature of the two-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity as a quantum theory.
