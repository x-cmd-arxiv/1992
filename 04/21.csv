suggestions that impurities could trigger parity breaking in 2d crystals, we
have analyzed the spectrum of the Dirac equation on a two dimensional square
lattice where sites have been removed randomly --- a doped lattice. We have
found that the system is well described by a sine-Gordon action. The solitons
of this model are the lattice fermions, which pick a quartic interaction due to
the doping and become Thirring fermions. They also get an effective mass
different from the lagrangian mass. The system seems to exhibit spontaneous
symmetry breaking, exactly as it happens for a randomly triangulated lattice.
The associated ``Goldstone boson"" is the sine-Gordon scalar. We argue, however,
that the peculiar behaviour of the chiral condensate is due to finite size
effects.

particles. By taking this suggestion seriously it is possible to cobble
together an elementary particle physics based estimate for the decay rate
$(\hbox{black hole})_i \to (\hbox{black hole})_f + (\hbox{massless quantum})$.
This estimate of the spontaneous emission rate contains two free parameters
which may be fixed by demanding that the high energy end of the spectrum of
emitted quanta match a blackbody spectrum at the Hawking temperature. The
calculation, though technically trivial, has important conceptual implications:
(1) The existence of Hawking radiation from black holes is ultimately dependent
only on the fact that massless quanta (and all other forms of matter) couple to
gravity. (2) The thermal nature of the Hawking spectrum depends only on the
fact that the number of internal states of a large mass black hole is enormous.
(3) Remarkably, the resulting formula for the decay rate gives meaningful
answers even when extrapolated to low mass black holes. The analysis strongly
supports the scenario of complete evaporation as the endpoint of the Hawking
radiation process (no naked singularity, no stable massive remnant).

conformal models. The constraints we start with are implemented by the Virasoro
generators depending on a background charge $Q$. Then the solutions to the
constraints are given by the theory which has the same field content as the
David-Distler-Kawai theory: it consists of a minimal matter scalar with
background charge $Q$, dressed with an extra `Liouville' scalar. The
construction is based on a generalization of the Kontsevich parametrization of
the KP times achieved by introducing into it Miwa parameters which depend on
the value of $Q$. Under the thus defined Kontsevich-Miwa transformation, the
Virasoro constraints are proven to be equivalent to a master equation depending
on the parameter $Q$. The master equation is further identified with a
null-vector decoupling equation. We conjecture that $W^{(n)}$ constraints on
the KP hierarchy are similarly related to a level-$n$ decoupling equation. We
also consider the master equation for the $N$-reduced KP hierarchies. Several
comments are made on a possible relation of the generalized master equation to
{\it scaled} Kontsevich-type matrix integrals and on the form the equation
takes in higher genera.

and a d dimensional compact space ($K^d$), there can exist topological solitons
that simultaneously wind around $R^3$ (or $R^2$ or $R^1$) in $M^4$ and the
compact dimensions. A paradigmatic non-gravitational example of such
``co-winding"" solitons is furnished by Yang-Mills theory defined on $M^4 X
S^1$. Pointlike, stringlike and sheetlike solitons can be identified by
transcribing and generalizing the proceedure used to construct the periodic
instanton (caloron) solutions. Asymptotically the classical pointlike objects
have non-Abelian magnetic dipole fields together with a non-Abelian scalar
potential while the ``color"" electric charge is zero. However quantization of
collective coordinates associated with zeromodes and coupling to fermions can
radically change these quantum numbers due to fermion number fractionalization
and its non-Abelian generalization. Interpreting the YM group as color (or the
Electroweak SU(2) group) and assuming that an extra circular dimension exists
thus implies the existence of topologically stable solitonic objects which
carry baryon(lepton) number and a mass O($1/g^2R$), where R is the radius of
the compact dimension.
