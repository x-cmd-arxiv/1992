neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological
distances. Bursts with complex profiles and relatively long durations are the
result of magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a post-merger
differentially-rotating disk. Some bursts may also be produced through
neutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electrons and positrons. In both cases,
an optically thick fireball of size $\sles\ 100$ km is initially created, which
expands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. Several previous
objections to the cosmological merger model are eliminated. It is predicted
that $\gamma$-ray bursts will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational
radiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.

determined from the QCD scale anomaly, and from deep inelastic scattering. We
apply our results to the $\Upsilon$ and $J/\psi$, treating the $\qqbar$
interaction as purely Coulombic. We find the $\Upsilon$ binds in nuclear matter
with a binding energy of a few $\mev$, while for the $J/\psi$ binding is of
order 10 $\mev$. For the $J/\psi$ in particular we expect confinement effects
to produce large corrections to this result.

far larger than in the standard model. In this note we reconsider this
mechanism, and illustrate it in a model in which the rates can be reliably

relevant to the study of anyon superconductors in which the anyons are

possible to find a mean field solution to the equations of motion for this
system which has some of the features of bose condensation. The mean field
solution consists of a lattice of vortices each carrying a single quantum of
statistical magnetic flux. We speculate on the effects of the quantum
corrections to this mean field solution. We argue that the mean field solution
is only stable under quantum corrections if the Chern--Simons coefficient
$N=2\pi\theta/g^2$ is an integer. Consequences for anyon superconductivity are
