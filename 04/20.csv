with topological Yang-Mills theory as a generalization of the BRS analysis
developed for the non-Abelian anomaly in the local Yang-Mills theory. We show
that our BRST algebra leads to an extended {\it Russian formula\/} and {\it
descent equations}, which contains the descent equation of Yang-Mills theory as
sub-relations. We propose the non-Abelian anomaly counterpart in Topological
Yang-Mills theory using the extended descent equation. We also discuss the
geometrical structure of our BRST symmetry and some explicit solutions of the
extended descent equation are calculated.

of the non Borel-summability of the perturbation theory is studied. A new
prescription to deal with small coupling is proposed. It leads to a series,
which at low orders and small coupling differs from the ordinary perturbative
series by nonperturbative amount, but is Borel-summable.

represented as Landau--Ginzburg theories with a quasihomogeneous potential
which has an isolated singularity at the origin. There are at least three
thousand distinct models in this class. All vacua of this type lead to Euler
numbers which lie in the range $-960 \leq \chi \leq 960$. The Euler
characteristics do not pair up completely hence the space of Landau--Ginzburg
ground states is not mirror symmetric even though it exhibits a high degree of
symmetry. We discuss in some detail the relation between Landau--Ginzburg
models and Calabi--Yau manifolds and describe a subtlety regarding
Landau--Ginzburg potentials with an arbitrary number of fields. We also show
that the use of topological identities makes it possible to relate
Landau-Ginzburg theories to types of Calabi-Yau manifolds for which the usual
Landau-Ginzburg framework does not apply.

model is established and shown to be equivalent to a recently proposed
supersymmetrization of the bosonic collective string field theory. It also
corresponds to a continuum description of super-Calogero models. The
perturbation theory of the model is developed and, in this approach, an
infinite sequence of vertices is generated. A class of potentials is identified
for which the spectrum is that of a massless boson and Majorana fermion. For
the harmonic oscillator case, the cubic vertices are obtained in an oscillator
basis. For a rather general class of potentials it is argued that one cannot
generate from Marinari-Parisi models a continuum limit similar to that of the
d=1 bosonic string.

an orientation preserving expanding map which maps each of these subintervals
to the whole unit interval. The set of points where all iterates of this
expanding map are defined is a Cantor set. Associated to the construction of
this Cantor set is the scaling function which records the infinitely deep
geometry of this Cantor set. This scaling function is an invariant of $C^1$
conjugation. We solve the inverse problem posed by Dennis Sullivan: given a
scaling function, determine the maximal possible smoothness of any expanding
map which produces it.
