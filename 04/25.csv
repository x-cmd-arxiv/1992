way that is still mysterious, though by now it has been proved by Kontsevich.
In this paper it is shown that a similar relation between topological and
physical Yang-Mills theory holds in two dimensions; in this case, however, the
relation can be explained by a direct mapping between the two path integrals.
This (1) explains many strange facts about two dimensional Yang-Mills theory,
like the way the partition function can be expressed exactly as a sum over
classical solutions, including unstable ones; (2) makes the corresponding
topological theory completely computable.

constant. We examine some of the constraints imposed by unitarity. These
completely determine (N,2) amplitudes at tree level in terms of the (N,1)
amplitudes when the plus tachyon momenta take generic values. A surprising
feature of the matrix model results is the lack of particle creation branch
cuts in the higher genus amplitudes. In fact, we show the naive field theory
limit of Liouville theory would predict such branch cuts. However, unitarity in
the full string theory ensures that such cuts do not appear in genus one (N,1)
amplitudes. We conclude with some comments about the genus one (N,2)
amplitudes.
