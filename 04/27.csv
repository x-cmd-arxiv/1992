by intervening galaxies: image splittings, relative amplifications, time
delays, and optical depths, provide separate measures of the strength of the
gravitational constant $G$ at cosmological distances. These allow one, in
principle, to factor out unknown lensing parameters to directly to probe the
variation of $G$ over cosmological time. We estimate constraints on $\dot{G}$
which may be derivable by this method both now and in the future. The limits
one may obtain can compete or exceed other direct limits on $\dot{G}$ today,
but unfortunately extracting this information, is not independent of the effort
to fix other cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_0$ from lensing
observations.

all scales of a problem, it seeks to perform various computational tasks at a
cost that rises as slowly as possible as a function of $n$, the number of
degrees of freedom in the problem. Current and potential benefits for lattice
field computations are outlined. They include: $O(n)$ solution of Dirac
equations; just $O(1)$ operations in updating the solution (upon any local
change of data, including the gauge field); similar efficiency in gauge fixing
and updating; $O(1)$ operations in updating the inverse matrix and in
calculating the change in the logarithm of its determinant; $O(n)$ operations
per producing each independent configuration in statistical simulations
(eliminating CSD), and, more important, effectively just $O(1)$ operations per
each independent measurement (eliminating the volume factor as well). These
potential capabilities have been demonstrated on simple model problems.
Extensions to real life are explored.

investigated. First we consider $SU_q(2)$ $\sigma$ model ($q$ real) expressed
in terms of basic notions of noncommutative differential geometry. We discuss
the case in which the $\sigma$ models fields are represented as products of
conventional $\sigma$ fields and of the coordinate-independent algebra. An
explicit example is provided by the $U_q(2)$ $\sigma$ model with $q\sp{N}=1$,
in which case quantum matrices $U_q(2)$ are realised as $2N\times 2N$ unitary
matrices. Open problems are pointed out.
