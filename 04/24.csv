and three dimensions, using symmetry, gauge invariance, and gradient
expansions. Our derivation provides explicit justification for the ``principle
of local symmetry,'' which has been used extensively to describe two
dimensional crack growth, but goes beyond that principle to describe three
dimensional crack phenomena as well. We also find that there are new materials
properties needed to describe the growth of general cracks in three dimensions,
besides the fracture toughness and elastic constants previously used to
describe cracking.

Some Chern--Simons terms are necessary in the lagrangian to realize the
discrete symmetries correctly. We consider also another parametrization of the
low energy sector which leads to a three dimensional analogue of the
Wess--Zumino--Witten--Novikov model. Since three dimensional QCD is believed to
be a model for quantum anti--ferromagnetism, our effective lagrangian can
describe their long wavelength excitations (spin waves).

splittings are smaller in the soliton model by a factor of $\log {F_\pi\over

of the deuteron. These solitons can describe defects in a quantum

a random lattice. The model on a regular lattice is known to be critical only
for $-2\le n\le 2$. This is the situation we shall discuss also here, using
steepest descent. We first determine the critical and multicritical points,
recovering in particular results previously obtained by Kostov. We then
calculate the scaling behaviour in the critical region when the cosmological
constant is close to its critical value. Like for the multi-matrix models, all
critical points can be classified in terms of two relatively prime integers
$p,q$. In the parametrization $p=(2m+1)q \pm l$, $m,l$ integers such that
$0<l<q$, the string susceptibility exponent is found to be $\gamma_{\rm
string}=-2l/(p+q-l)$. When $l=1$ we find that all results agree with those of
the corresponding $(p,q)$ string models, otherwise they are different.\par We
finally explain how to derive the large order behaviour of the corresponding
topological expansion in the double scaling limit.
