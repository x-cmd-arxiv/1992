high-temperature \(g^2\phi^4\) field theory model up to order $g^4$. From this
the zero momentum pole of the effective propagator is evaluated to determine
the induced thermal mass and damping rate for the bosons in the plasma to order
$g^3$. The calculations are performed in the imaginary time formalism and a
simple diagrammatic analysis is used to identify the relevant diagrams at each
order. Results are compared with similar real-time calculations found in the
literature.

algebra (its classical version) in terms of the spin 1 and spin 2
supercurrents. Two closely related types of the Feigin-Fuchs representation for
these supercurrents are found: via two chiral spin $\frac{1}{2}$ superfields
generating $N=2$ extended $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebras and via two free chiral
spin 0 superfields. We also construct a one-parameter family of $N=2$ super
Boussinesq equations for which $N=2$ super-$W_3$ provides the second
hamiltonian structure.

application, a formal expression for an automorphic function, which is a
candidate for a non--perturbative superpotential, is given.

first-order $(b,c,\beta,\gamma)$-systems, and show that an arbitrary
Landau-Ginzburg interaction with quasi-homogeneous potential can be introduced
without spoiling the (2,2)-superconformal invariance. We discuss the
topological twisting and the renormalization group properties of these
theories, and compare them to the conventional topological Landau-Ginzburg
models. We show that in our formulation the parameters multiplying deformation
terms in the potential are flat coordinates. After properly bosonizing the
first-order systems, we are able to make explicit calculations of topological
correlation functions as power series in these flat coordinates by using
standard Coulomb gas techniques. We retrieve known results for the minimal
models and for the torus.
