antiferromagnets in the vicinity of a zero-temperature phase transition from
long-range magnetic order to a quantum disordered phase are studied. Random
antiferromagnets with both N\'{e}el and spin-glass long-range magnetic order
are considered. Explicit quantum-critical dynamic scaling functions are
computed in a 1/N expansion to two-loops for certain non-random, frustrated
square lattice antiferromagnets. Implications for neutron scattering
experiments on the doped cuprates are noted.

form of a product of a wave function for charged semions in a magnetic field
and a wave function for the Chiral Spin Liquid of neutral spin-$\12$ semions.
We introduce field-theoretic model in which the electron operators are
factorized in terms of charged spinless semions (holons) and neutral spin-$\12$
semions (spinons). Broken time reversal symmetry and short ranged spin
correlations lead to $SU(2)_{k=1}$ Chern-Simons term in Landau-Ginzburg action
for SQHE phase. We construct appropriate coherent states for SQHE phase and
show the existence of $SU(2)$ valued gauge potential. This potential appears as
a result of ``spin rigidity"" of the ground state against any displacements of
nodes of wave function from positions of the particles and reflects the
nontrivial monodromy in the presence of these displacements. We argue that
topological structure of $SU(2)_{k=1}$ Chern-Simons theory unambiguously
dictates {\it semion} statistics of spinons.

this kind of pairing, ii) in many cases there is no gap in the quasiparticle
spectrum, iii) these superconductors will exhibit a Meissner effect.

of fluid profiles as `strings' the action is written in a four-dimensional form
in terms of gauge fields built out of the embedding of the `string' in the

above action provided one restricts to quadratic fluid profiles and ignores the
dynamics of their `turning points'.
