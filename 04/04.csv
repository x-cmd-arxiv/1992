field that belongs to a non-compact group. We treat in some details the
$SL(2,{\bf R})$ and the Poincar\'e $ISO(2,1)$ groups. For suitable
self-interactions, we are able to exhibit soliton solutions.

"hep-th/9204009",,"Giuseppe Bonacina, Maurizio Martellini and Mario Rasetti","2+1 Dimensional Quantum Gravity as a Gaussian Fermionic System and the
  3D-Ising Model",,,,,"hep-th",,"  We show that 2+1-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity is equivalent, under
some mild topological assumptions, to a Gaussian fermionic system. In
particular, for manifolds topologically equivalent to $\Sigma_g\times\RrR$ with
$\Sigma_g$ a closed and oriented Riemann surface of genus $g$, the
corresponding 2+1-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity may be related to the
3D-lattice Ising model before its thermodynamic limit.

integral formalism. It is characterized by picking up the imaginary part from
the resultant exponent. Discussion is made on the generalized harmonic
oscillator which is shown being so universal in a single degree case. The spin
model expressed by creation and annihilation operators is also discussed. A
systematic way of expansion in the adiabatic approximation is presented in
every example.
