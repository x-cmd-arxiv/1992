  Quantum Gravity","10 pages","Mod. Phys. Lett. A7 (1992) 1519","10.1142/S0217732392001191",,"hep-lat",,"  We perform Monte Carlo simulations using the Wolff cluster algorithm of the
q=2 (Ising), 3, 4 and q=10 Potts models on dynamical phi-cubed graphs of
spherical topology with up to 5000 nodes. We find that the measured critical
exponents are in reasonable agreement with those from the exact solution of the
Ising model and with those calculated from KPZ scaling for q=3,4 where no exact
solution is available. Using Binder's cumulant we find that the q=10 Potts
model displays a first order phase transition on a dynamical graph, as it does
on a fixed lattice. We also examine the internal geometry of the graphs
generated in the simulation, finding a linear relationship between ring length
probabilities and the central charge of the Potts model

exclusive two--body decay channels using the Bauer--Stech--Wirbel model for
current matrix elements. The influence of the free parameters of the model on
the predictions is studied. The total branching ratio of the $B_s$ into final
states which only contain stable charged particles is found to be about
$10^{-3}$.

using three different regularizations (dimensional, Pauli-Villars and lattice)
and find an extra contribution to the S parameter besides the standard one for
each case. This shows that the extra contribution recently reported for the
lattice regularization is {\it not} necessarily tied to the non-decoupling
effect of fermion doublers. We argue that the extra contribution should be
subtracted in the renormalizable perturbative expansion.

derive general expressions for them, both for $(2,2)$ and $(2,0)$ models, in
terms of tree level four-point functions in the internal $N=2$ superconformal
theory. The $(2,2)$ case, in particular symmetric orbifolds, is discussed in
detail.
