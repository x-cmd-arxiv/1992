layered high-Tc superconductors. Careful inelastic neutron scattering
measurements at low temperature of the phonon dispersion curves in the (100)
direction in La_(1.85)Sr_(.15)CuO_4 would determine whether the gap is
predominately s-wave or d-wave. We also propose an experiment to determine the
gap at each point on a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface.

Euclidean quantum gravity in four dimensions within the Regge calculus. The
action is bounded without additional terms by fixing the average lattice
spacing. We set the length scale by a parameter $\beta$ and consider a scale
invariant and a uniform measure. In the low $\beta$ region we observe a phase
with negative curvature and a homogeneous distribution of the link lengths
independent of the measure. The large $\beta$ region is characterized by
inhomogeneous link lengths distributions with spikes and positive curvature
depending on the measure.

thermodynamic limit, where the model becomes invariant under the action of
affine U_q( sl(2) ).
  Our method is based on the representation theory of quantum affine algebras,
the related vertex operators and KZ equation, and thereby bypasses the usual
process of starting from a finite lattice, taking the thermodynamic limit and
filling the Dirac sea. From recent results on the algebraic structure of the
corner transfer matrix of the model, we obtain the vacuum vector of the
Hamiltonian. The rest of the eigenvectors are obtained by applying the vertex
operators, which act as particle creation operators in the space of
eigenvectors.
  We check the agreement of our results with those obtained using the Bethe
Ansatz in a number of cases, and with others obtained in the scaling limit ---
the $su(2)$-invariant Thirring model.
