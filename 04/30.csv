and flat $\log N$ {\it vs.} $\log S$ of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. These data are
best explained if the burst sources are distributed throughout an extended
spherical Galactic halo, as previously suggested by Jennings. The halo's radius
is at least 40 Kpc, and probably is more than 100 Kpc. I consider possible
origins of this halo, including primordial formation and neutron stars
recoiling from their birthplaces in the Galactic disc. A simple geometrical
model leads to a predicted relation between the dipole and quadrupole
anisotropy. I suggest that neutron stars born with low recoil become
millisecond pulsars, while those born with high recoil become the sources of
gamma-ray bursts; these populations are nearly disjoint. Quiescent counterparts
of gamma-ray bursts are predicted to be undetectably faint.

microscopically and an equation of motion for vortex motion at non-zero
frequencies is derived. Of interest are frequencies near $\Delta^{2}/E_{F}$,
where $\Delta$ is the bulk energy gap and $E_{F}$ is the fermi energy. The low
temperature, clean, extreme type II limit and maintaining of equilibrium with
the lattice are assumed. A simplification occurs for large planar mass
anisotropy. Thus the results may be pertinent to materials such as $NbSe_2$ and
high temperature superconductors. The expected dipole transition between core
states is hidden because of the self consistent nature of the vortex potential.
Instead the vortex itself moves and has a resonance at the frequency of the
transition.

  Nonperturbative Considerations","31 pages","Phys.Rev.D46:4016-4028,1992","10.1103/PhysRevD.46.4016",,"hep-lat hep-ph",,"  Perturbative analyses seem to suggest that fermions whose mass comes solely
from a Yukawa coupling to a scalar field can be made arbitrarily heavy, while
the scalar remains light. The effects of the fermion can be summarized by a
local effective Lagrangian for the light degrees of freedom. Using weak
coupling and large N techniques, we present a variety of models in which this
conclusion is shown to be false when nonperturbative variations of the scalar
field are considered. The heavy fermions contribute nonlocal terms to the
effective action for light degrees of freedom. This resolves paradoxes about
anomalous and nonanomalous symmetry violation in these models. Application of
these results to lattice gauge theory imply that attempts to decouple lattice
fermion doubles by the method of Swift and Smit cannot succeed, a result
already suggested by lattice calculations.

functions contributes at zero recoil, where it is calculable to lowest order in
an operator product expansion in terms of the meson decay constant $f_B$ and
