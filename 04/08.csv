the quantum numbers of baryons and mesons, constructed out of quark and
anti-quark solitons. In isolation the latter solitons have infinite energy,
corresponding to the presence of a string carrying the non-singlet colour flux
off to spatial infinity. When $N_c$ solitons of this type are combined, a
static, finite-energy, colour singlet solution is formed, corresponding to a
baryon. Similarly, static meson solutions are formed out of a soliton and an
anti-soliton of different flavours. The stability of the mesons against
annihilation is ensured by flavour conservation. The static solutions exist
only when the fundamental fields of the bosonized Lagrangian belong to
$U(N_c{\times}N_f)$ rather than to $SU(N_c) \times U(N_f)$. Discussion of
flavour symmetry breaking requires a careful treatment of the normal ordering
ambiguity. Our results can be viewed as a derivation of the constituent quark
model in QCD$_2$, allowing a detailed study of constituent mass generation and
of the heavy quark symmetry.

theories of gravity with $\Phi$--dependent masses. We investigate a scenario
(which can arise in string theories) with two types of $\Phi$--dependent masses
which could correspond to visible and dark matter sectors. The parameters of
this theory are constrained from post--Newtonian bounds, primordial
nucleosynthesis and the age of the Universe. We present a perfect fluid
formalism for the dark matter sector with variable masses and find an entropy
increase effect during the matter era and, in principle, a measurable effect on
the motion of the halo of spiral galaxies. For the case of string effective
theories, the constancy of gauge couplings provide new bounds which are orders
of magnitude stronger than the previous ones.

manifolds, one introduces n Ising spins on each cell, i.e. a discrete version
of 2D quantum gravity coupled to matter with a central charge n/2. The
matrix-model consists then of an integral over $2^{n}$ matrices, which we are
unable to solve for $n>1$. However for a fixed genus we can expand in the
cosmological constant g for arbitrary values of n, and a simple minded analysis
of the series yields for n=0,1 and 2 the expected results for the exponent
$\gamma_{string}$ with an amazing precision given the small number of terms
that we considered. We then proceed to larger values of n. Simple tests of
universality are successfully applied; for instance we obtain the same
exponents for n=3 or for one Ising model coupled to a one dimensional target
space. The calculations are easily extended to states Potts models, through an
integration over $q^{n}$ matrices. We see no sign of the tachyonic instability
of the theory, but we have only considered genus zero at this stage.

ring structure which has a very particular form. All such rings studied so far
were shown to arise from some potentials. In this paper the fusion rings of the
WZW models based on the symplectic group are studied. It is shown that they
indeed arise from potentials which are described. These potentials give rise to
new massive perturbations of superconformal hermitian symmetric models. The
metric of the perturbation is computed and is shown to be given by solutions of
the sinh--gordon equation. The kink structure of the theories is described, and
it is argued that these field theories are integrable. The $S$ matrices for the
fusion theories are argued to be non--minimal extensions of the $G_k\times G_1/
G_{k+1}$ $S$ matrices with the adjoint perturbation, in the case of $G=SU(N)$.
