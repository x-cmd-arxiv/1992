  et al. (Lectures presented at the Lake Louise Winter Institute, February,
  1992)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The main focus of these lectures is on those aspects of deep inelastic
scattering that can be derived directly from QCD using quantum field theory,
without recourse to phenomenological models. The emphasis is on spin dependent
scattering, but the theory of spin averaged scattering is also discussed. A
detailed analysis is given for the case of spin 1/2 targets, with a brief
discussion of higher spin targets at the end. The QCD derivation of the
Callan-Gross relation, the longitudinal structure function $F_L$, and the
Bjorken and Ellis-Jaffe sum rules is presented. I also discuss the
Wilczek-Wandzura contribution to $g_2$, and why the Gottfried sum rule does not
hold in QCD.

  Wess-Zumino field","21 pages",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Some spontaneously broken gauge theories with left couplings to fermions,
like the abelian model that we propose here, can be endowed with a composite
scalar sector and Wess-Zumino field ; their quantization in the functionnal
integral formalism accordingly requires the introduction of constraints that,
together with the breaking of the gauge symmetry by the scalars, and among
other consequences, give the Higgs field and the fermions (quarks) infinite
masses; this makes them unobservable. Gauge invariance and unitarity are
achieved through a derivative coupling of the W-Z field to the fermionic
current; the anomaly gets cancelled in the above infinite fermion mass limit.
We show how the problems of renormalizability are evaded at the one-loop level
by resumming diagrams at the ladder approximation and reshuffling the
perturbative series, and because the fermionic current is conserved. The
Wess-Zumino field can be ""gauged away"" to become the 3rd polarization of the
massive gauge field; the pseudoscalar partner of the Higgs, tightly linked to
the W-Z field, behaves like an abelian pion. In particular, no extra scale of
interaction has to be introduced, unlike in ""technicolour"" theories. Problems
concerning the leptonic sector are only mentionned.

excitations in high-temperature QED and QCD to be gauge-fixing-dependent even
within the resummation scheme due to Braaten and Pisarski. It is shown that
this problem is caused by the singular nature of the on-shell expansion of the
fermion self-energy in the infra-red. Its regularization reveals that the
alleged gauge dependence pertains to the residue rather than the pole of the
fermion propagator, so that in particular the damping constant comes out
gauge-independent, as it should.

the hidden sector as a potential source of hierarchical supersymmetry breaking
and a non--trivial potential for the dilaton $S$ whose real part corresponds to
the tree level gauge coupling constant (${\rm Re}\ S\sim g_{gut}^{-2}$). For
the case of pure Yang--Mills condensation, we show that no realistic results
(in particular no reasonable values for ${\rm Re}\ S$) can emerge, even if the
hidden gauge group is not simple. However, in the presence of hidden matter
(i.e. the most frequent case) there arises a very interesting class of
scenarios with two or more hidden condensing groups for which the dilaton
dynamically acquires a reasonable value (${\rm Re}\ S\sim 2$) and supersymmetry
is broken at the correct scale ($m_{3/2}\sim 10^3\ GeV$) with no need of
fine--tuning. Actually, good values for ${\rm Re}\ S$ and $m_{3/2}$ are
correlated. We make an exhaustive classification of the working possibilities.
Remarkably, the results are basically independent from the value of
$\delta^{GS}$ (the contributions from the Green--Schwarz mechanism). The radius
of the compactified space also acquires an expectation value, breaking duality
spontaneously.

  THEOREM
  (i) If there is a singular strong limit cardinal $\kappa$ such that $2^\kappa
> kappa^+$ then there is an inner model with a cardinal $\kappa$ such that for
all ordinals $\alpha<\kappa$ there is an ordinal $\nu < \kappa$ with $o(\nu) >
\alpha$.
  (ii) If there is a singular strong limit cardinal $\kappa$ of uncountable
cofinality such that $2^\kappa > \kappa^+$ then there is an inner model with
$o(\kappa) = \kappa^{++}$.
  Since this paper was originally submitted, Gitik has improved this result to
give exact lower bounds.
