We show that the model is equivalent to $N$ fermions with spin in a central
potential that also includes a long-range ferromagnetic interaction between the
fermions that falls off as $1/(r_{ij})^2$. We find two interesting scaling
limits and calculate the free energy for both situations. One limit corresponds
to Dirichlet boundary conditions for the dual graphs and the other corresponds
to Neumann conditions. We compute the boundary cosmological constant and show
that it is of order $1/\log(\beta)$. We also briefly discuss a possible analog
of the Das-Jevicki field for the open string tachyon. (n.b. This is a revised
version of paper previously submitted to xxx@lanl.gov. The original version
misidentified the Dirichlet and Neumann cases. This version also includes
references to work by Yang that was missing in the original.)

fifties and early sixties, and then after subsequent development by Kucha\v r,
the canonical dynamical structure of general relativity has often been viewed
as that of a parametrized field theory in which the many-fingered spacetime
variables are hidden amongst the geometrodynamical field variables. This
paradigm of general relativity as an ``already parametrized theory'' forms the
basis for one of the most satisfactory resolutions of the problems of time and
observables in classical and quantum gravity. However, despite decades of
effort, no identification of many-fingered spacetime variables has ever been
satisfactorily obtained for vacuum general relativity. We point out that there
is an obstruction to identifying the constraint surface of general relativity
(for the case of a closed universe) with that of any parametrized theory.
Therefore, strictly speaking, general relativity cannot be viewed as a
parametrized field theory. We discuss implications for the canonical
quantization program.

phase is allowed and the (anti-) de Sitter or Poincar\'e symmetry remains
intact. Spontaneous symmetry breaking to the Lorentz group occurs if a scalar
field is included. This Higgs field can then be used to couple matter so that
the familiar form of the matter coupling is established in the broken phase. We
also give the supersymmetrization of this construction.

approach can be extended to other nonlinear algebras and integrable systems.
