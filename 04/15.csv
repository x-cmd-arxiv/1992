A 45 (1992) 8727","10.1103/PhysRevA.45.8727",,"cond-mat",,"  We develop a theory of polymers in a nematic solvent by exploiting an analogy
with two-dimensional quantum bosons at zero temperature. We argue that the
theory should also describe polymers in an {\sl isotropic} solvent. The dense
phase is analyzed in a Bogoliubov-like approximation, which assumes a broken
symmetry in the phase of the boson order parameter. We find a stiffening of the
longitudinal fluctuations of the nematic field, calculate the density-density
correlation function, and extend the analysis to the case of ferro- and
electrorheological fluids. The boson formalism is used to derive a simple
hydrodynamic theory which is indistinguishable from the corresponding theory of
polymer nematics in an isotropic solvent at long wavelengths. We also use
hydrodynamics to discuss the physical meaning of the boson order parameter. A
renormalization group treatment in the dilute limit shows that logarithmic
corrections to polymer wandering, predicted by de Gennes, are unaffected by
interpolymer interactions. A continuously variable Flory exponent appears for
polymers embedded in a {\sl two}-dimensional nematic solvent. We include free
polymer ends and hairpin configurations in the theory and show that hairpins
are described by an Ising-like symmetry-breaking term in the boson field
theory.

superstring compactifications on \cy threefolds these identities are equivalent
to the Picard-Fuchs equations of algebraic geometry that are obeyed by the
periods of the holomorphic three-form. For one variable they reduce to linear
fourth-order equations which are characterized by classical $W$-generators; we
find that the instanton corrections to the Yukawa couplings are directly
related to the non-vanishing of $w_4$. We also show that the symplectic
structure of special geometry can be related to the fact that the Yukawa
couplings can be written as triple derivatives of some holomorphic function
$F$. Moreover, we give the precise relationship of the Yukawa couplings of
special geometry with three-point functions in topological field theory.

external three index gauge potential. We compute the low energy limit of the

generalized bootstrap hypothesis is made in order to identify the physical
metric and gauge field with the lowest order terms in the expansion of the
vacuum average of the composite operators conjugate to the background fields.
We find that the large distance behaviour of these classical fields is
described by the Einstein action with a cosmological term plus a Maxwell type
action for the gauge potential. The Maxwell term enables us to apply the
Hawking-Baum argument to show that the physical cosmological constant is
``~probably~'' zero.

investigated by the third author in [Sh:98]. In particular it was essentially
shown there that there is a non-free Whitehead (respectively,
aleph_1-coseparable) group of cardinality aleph_1 if and only if there is a
ladder system on a stationary subset of omega_1 which satisfies
2-uniformization (respectively, omega-uniformization). These techniques allowed
also the proof of various independence and consistency results about Whitehead
groups, for example that it is consistent that there is a non-free Whitehead
group of cardinality aleph_1 but no non-free aleph_1-coseparable group.
However, some natural questions remained open, among them the following two:
(i) Is it consistent that the class of W-groups of cardinality aleph_1 is
exactly the class of strongly aleph_1-free groups of cardinality aleph_1 ? (ii)
If every strongly aleph_1-free group of cardinality aleph_1 is a W-group, are
they also all aleph_1-coseparable? In this paper we use the techniques of
uniformization to answer the first question in the negative and give a partial
affirmative answer to the second question.
