study the one-component $Z_2$ symmetric and the four-component O(4) symmetric
scalar models coupled to staggered fermions using the hybrid Monte Carlo

tree level perturbative behaviour at all points in the broken phase. The O(4)
model on the other hand is shown to have two characteristically different
behaviours; one for large Yukawa couplings where the fermions get infinitely
heavy and decouple in the continuum limit, and one for small Yukawa couplings
where the fermions remain light. For very small Yukawa couplings the fermions
show the expected tree level perturbative behaviour and for larger values the
influence of the fermions becomes substantial. After estimating the finite size
effects at small Yukawa couplings we make relatively accurate measurements of
the scalar mass and wave function renormalization constants at the point
$\kappa=0.0$ and $y=0.85-0.95$. Even though this is not the largest value
possible for the Yukawa coupling we are able to show that the bound of the
Higgs mass will move up significantly, from around $600 GeV$ to around $900

put on the fermion mass, around $200 GeV$. The largest value of the bare Yukawa
coupling is obtained at rather large negative $\kappa$. Due to bad convergence
rates in the inversion of the fermion matrix, which is needed in the updating
