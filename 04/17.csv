measured on the lattice using an effective field theory for heavy quarks.
Various discretizations of the heavy-light bilinears which appear in this and
other B decay matrix elements are possible. The heavy-light bilinear currently
used for the determination of the B meson decay constant on the lattice suffers
a substantial one-loop renormalization. In this paper, we compute the one-loop
renormalizations of the discretizations in which the heavy and light fields in
the bilinear are separated by one lattice spacing, and discuss their
application. Readers of this paper may also be interested in our paper on the
application of Symanzik's improvement program to heavy-light currents (paper
number 9203221 on hep-ph).

transition rate in a system at finite temperature. We find that in certain
models, such as the 1+1 Abelian Higgs model, the quantum contribution is
non-negligible even at large temperatures. We show how the persistence of the
cosmological baryon asymmetry yields a bound on the inclusive two particle
cross section in the anomalous (B violating) sector.

extended algebra which results from incorporating the currents at negative

naturally induces the Bethe Ansatz. The recurrence relations determined by
Gamma_q(1) permit to express the energy of the n-magnon bound states in a

relativity, we focus on: phase space representations of the spacetime
diffeomorphism group, construction of observables, and the relationship between

notes on investigations about iteration trees. They will be of interest only to
the specialist.
  In the first two sections I define notions of support and embeddings for tree
iterations, proving for example that every tree iteration is a direct limit of
finite tree iterations. This is a generalization to models with extenders of
basic ideas of iterated ultrapowers using only ultrapowers.
  In the final section (which is most of the paper) I sketch a proof that any
tree iteration can be embedded into a normal iteration, that is, a tree
iteration with the extenders in nondecreasing order of strength and with
strictly increasing critical points.
