center-of-mass energy range to detect intermediate or heavy Higgs bosons in the
Standard Model. We first briefly assess the production cross sections and
update the decay branching fractions for a Higgs boson of intermediate mass,
with M_Z < m_H < 2M_W. We then study in detail the possibility of detecting a
heavy Higgs boson, with m_H > 2M_W, through the production of pairs of weak
bosons. We quantitatively analyze the sensitivity of the process e^+ e^- --> nu
nubar W^+ W^- (ZZ) to the presence of a heavy Higgs-boson resonance in the
Standard Model. We compare this signal to various backgrounds and to the
smaller signal from e^+ e^- --> ZH --> mu^+ mu^- W^+ W^- (ZZ), assuming the
weak-boson pairs to be detected and measured in their dominant hadronic decay
modes W^+ W^- (ZZ) --> 4jets. A related Higgs-boson signal in 6-jet final
states is also estimated. We show how the main backgrounds from e^+ e^- W^+ W^-
(ZZ), e nu WZ, and t tbar production can be reduced by suitable acceptance
cuts. Bremsstrahlung and typical beamstrahlung corrections are calculated.
These corrections reduce Higgs-boson production by scattering mechanisms but
increase production by annihilation mechanisms; they also smear out some
dynamical features such as Jacobian peaks in p_T(H). With all these corrections
included, we conclude that it should be possible to detect a heavy Higgs-boson
signal in the nu nubar W^+ W^-(ZZ) channels up to mass m_H=350 GeV.

effects between the Standard Model and the anomalous contributions to the

$WW\gamma$ couplings. Sensitivity limits for the anomalous $WW\gamma$ couplings
$\kappa$ and $\lambda$ at HERA and LEP/LHC are derived, taking into account
experimental cuts and uncertainties, and the form factor behaviour of
nonstandard couplings. These limits are found to be significantly weaker than
those which can be expected from other collider processes within the next few
years. At HERA, they are comparable to bounds obtained from $S$-matrix
unitarity.

itself in the manner of a ""tumbling"" gauge theory down to the standard model
with a top-quark condensate. Because of anomaly cancellation requirements, this
model contains two color sextet fermions (quixes), which are vector-like with
respect to the standard model gauge group. The model also has a large number of
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, some of which can be light. The top-quark
condensate is responsible for breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry and gives
the top quark a large mass. We discuss the qualitative features and instructive
shortcomings of the model in its present form. We also show that this model can
be naturally embedded into an aesthetically pleasing model in which the
standard model fermion families appear symmetrically.
