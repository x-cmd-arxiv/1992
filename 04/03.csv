  Curves","13 pages, LaTeX 2.09",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  Let $\Gamma$ be a plane curve of degree $d$ with $\delta$ ordinary nodes and
no other singularities. If $P$ is a smooth point on $\Gamma$ then the
Weierstrass gap sequence at $P$ is considered as that at the corresponding
point on the normalization of $\Gamma$. A smooth point $P\in\Gamma$ is called a
total inflection point if $i(\Gamma ,T;P)=d$ where $T$ is the tangent line to
$\Gamma$ at $P$. There are many possible Weierstrass gap sequences at total
inflection points. Our main results are: Among them (1) There exists a pair
$(P,\Gamma )$ such that the gap sequence at $P$ is the minimal (in the sense of
weight). (2) There exists a pair $(P,\Gamma )$ such that the gap sequence at
$P$ is the maximal (resp. up to 1 maximal). And we characterize these cases in
the sense of location of nodes.

temperatures can be subsequently erased by anomalous electroweak effects. We
argue that this is not necessarily the case in the supersymmetric standard
model because, apart from B and/or L, there are, above a certain temperature
$T_{SS}$, two other anomalous U(1) currents. As a consequence, anomalous
electroweak effects are only able to partially transform a B+L excess into a
generation of primordial sparticle (e.g. gaugino) density. This relaxes recent
bounds on B,L-violating non-renormalizable couplings by several orders of
magnitude. In particular, dimension-5 couplings inducing neutrino masses may be
4 orders of magnitude larger than in the non-supersymmetric case, allowing for
neutrino masses of the order of 10 eV. These values are consistent with a
MSW+see-saw explanation of the solar-neutrino data and also with possible
neutrino oscillations measurable at accelerators. Cosmological bounds on other
rare processes, such as neutron-antineutron oscillations get also relaxed by
several orders of magnitude compared with previous estimates.

both by renormalization effects and the gauge fixing procedure. Renormalized
primitive divergent amplitudes have the property that their form away from the
overall coincident point singularity is fully determined by the bare
Lagrangian, and scale dependence is restricted to $\delta$-functions at the
singularity. If gauge fixing could be ignored, one would expect these
amplitudes to be conformal invariant for non-coincident points. We find that
the one-loop three-gluon vertex function $\Gamma_{\mu\nu\rho}(x,y,z)$ is
conformal invariant in this sense, if calculated in the background field
formalism using the Feynman gauge for internal gluons. It is not yet clear why
the expected breaking due to gauge fixing is absent. The conformal property
implies that the gluon, ghost and quark loop contributions to
$\Gamma_{\mu\nu\rho}$ are each purely numerical combinations of two universal
conformal tensors $D_{\mu\nu\rho}(x,y,z)$ and $C_{\mu\nu\rho}(x,y,z)$ whose
explicit form is given in the text. Only $D_{\mu\nu\rho}$ has an ultraviolet
divergence, although $C_{\mu\nu\rho}$ requires a careful definition to resolve
the expected ambiguity of a formally linearly divergent quantity.
Regularization is straightforward and leads to a renormalized vertex function
which satisfies the required Ward identity, and from which the beta-function is
easily obtained. Exact conformal invariance is broken in higher-loop orders,
but we outline a speculative scenario in which the perturbative structure of
the vertex function is determined from a conformal invariant primitive core by
interplay of the renormalization group equation and Ward identities.
