Hamiltonians (e.g., due to impurities), the characteristic size L of the
ordered domains can grow only logarithmically with time t following a quench
below the transition temperature. However, in systems without such imposed
randomness, much faster power law growth has generally been predicted.
Motivated by the slow dynamics present in glasses, we have been looking for
counterexamples, i.e., for models without randomness which nonetheless order
logarithmically slowly. Here, we discuss two closely related models for which
we have simple physical arguments that such slow growth occurs. The basis of
these arguments is the claim that the free energy barriers to domain growth in
these models are proportional to L. Thus, the barriers grow as the domains
coarsen. We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations, which lend strong
support to our claims of growing barriers and logarithmically slow dynamics.
Finally, we discuss how quickly the system orders when it is cooled
continuously through the transition (rather than quenched).

$SU(n)$ colors interacting via inverse-square exchange is presented in this

the model Hamiltonians is constructed in terms of the Jastrow-product type wave
function. The class of states we construct in this paper corresponds to the
ground state and the low energy excitations of the model that can be described
by the effective harmonic fluid Hamiltonian. By expanding the energy about the
ground state we find the harmonic fluid parameters (i.e. the charge, spin
velocities, etc.), explicitly. The correlation exponent and the compressibility
of are also found. As expected the general harmonic relation(i.e.
$v_S=(v_Nv_J)^{1/2}$) is satisfied among the charge and spin velocities.

Starting from QED, we discuss the transition from three-- to two--dimensional
positronium discussing the latter in detail including relativistic effects. In
the case of QCD the problem is similar to that of heavy quarkonium. Our
effective potential contains the usual Coulomb and confining parts as well as a
perturbative spin--spin interaction. The resulting $\bar q q$ ``wave functions""
reproduce recent lattice data for the $\rho$ and $\pi$ channels. The physical
meaning of such `confinement' is related to the non--trivial magnetic
interaction of color currents in the quark--gluon plasma. Our results do not
contradict the idea that the normal electric interaction of color charges is
screened and produces no bound states in the usual sense.

of spectra for Virasoro strings with unusual central charge and intercepts.

polymers on a cylinder. We show, using the underlying N=2 supersymmetry, that
the scaling function for one non-contractible polymer loop around the cylinder
is simply related to the solution of the Painleve III differential equation. We
also find the ground-state energy for a single polymer on the cylinder. We
check these results by numerically simulating the polymer system. We also
analyze numerically the flow to the dense polymer phase. We find there
surprising results, with a $c_{\hbox{eff}}$ function that is not monotonous and
seems to have a roaming behavior, getting very close to the values 81/70 and
7/10 between its UV and IR values of 1.

the W-hair of spherically-symmetric four-dimensional objects with event
horizons, treated as effectively two-dimensional string black holes.
Measurements can be done either through the s-wave scattering of light
particles off the string black-hole background, or through interference
experiments of Aharonov-Bohm type. We also speculate on the role of the
extended W-symmetries possessed by the topological field theories that describe
the region of space-time around a singularity.
