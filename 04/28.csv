  Puzzle","24 pages","Phys.Rev. D47 (1993) 264-272","10.1103/PhysRevD.47.264",,"hep-ph",,"  We compute the threshold uncertainties due to unknown masses of the Higgs
bosons on the predictions for the intermediate and unification scales, $M_I$
and $M_U$ respectively in SO(10) models.We focus on models with separate
breaking scales for Parity and $SU(2)_R$ symmetries since they provide a
natural realization of the see-saw mechanism for neutrino masses. For the two
step symmetry breaking chains ,where left-right symmetric gauge groups appear
at the intermediate scale, we find that parity invariance of the theory at the
unification scale drastically reduces the GUT threshold effects in some cases.
Including the effects of the intermediate scale thresholds ,we compute the
uncertainty in the above mass scales and study their implications for proton
lifetime and neutrino masses. An important outcome of our analysis is that if
the currently favored nonadiabatic MSW solution to the solar neutrino puzzle is
accepted , it will rule out the $SU(2)_LXSU(2)_RXU(1)_{B-L}X SU(3)_c$ as an
intermediate symmetry for SO(10) breaking whereas the intermediate symmetry
$SU(2)_LXSU(2)_RXSU(4)_c$, is quite consistent with it.

  Analytical Results","19 pages (double-spaced)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The phase transition of the electroweak vacuum induced by a strong magnetic
field is examined, and a connection is made with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of
type-II superconductivity. For solutions of the exact nonlinear field equations
of the electroweak theory with lattice periodicity in directions perpendicular
to the magnetic field, it is proven that, likewise, each lattice cell must
enclose an integer number of quanta of magnetic flux. Close to the lower
critical magnetic field, a perturbative method developed by MacDowell and the
author is used to study properties of the lattice solutions. Analytical
expressions for observables are obtained in terms of a complex parameter $\tau$
specifying the lattice and it is shown that the triangular Abrikosov solution
constitutes a local minimum of the energy provided $M_H > M_Z$.

complicated by the fact that only in two spacetime dimensions is it impossible
to redefine the dilaton field in terms of a canonical scalar field. Finally, we
