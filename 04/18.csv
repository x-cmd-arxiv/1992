D46 (1992) 853-857","10.1103/PhysRevD.46.853",,"hep-lat",,"  [This version is a minor revision of a previously submitted preprint. Only
references have been changed.] We describe a technique for constructing the
effective chiral theory for quenched QCD. The effective theory which results is
a lagrangian one, with a graded symmetry group which mixes Goldstone bosons and
fermions, and with a definite (though slightly peculiar) set of Feynman rules.
The straightforward application of these rules gives automatic cancellation of
diagrams which would arise from virtual quark loops. The techniques are used to
calculate chiral logarithms in $f_K/f_\pi$, $m_\pi$, $m_K$, and the ratio of
$\langle{\bar s}s\rangle$ to $\langle{\bar u}u\rangle$. The leading
finite-volume corrections to these quantities are also computed. Problems for
future study are described.

conditions for static, zero-energy solutions of the $(2+1)$-dimensional gauged
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with Chern--Simons matter-gauge dynamics. In
this paper we classify all finite charge $SU(N)$ solutions by first
transforming the self-dual Chern--Simons equations into the two-dimensional
chiral model (or harmonic map) equations, and then using the Uhlenbeck--Wood
classification of harmonic maps into the unitary groups. This construction also
leads to a new relationship between the $SU(N)$ Toda and $SU(N)$ chiral model
solutions.
