its effect on the cosmic microwave background radiation. The new COBE
measurement of a cosmic background quadrupole anisotropy places an upper limit
on the vacuum energy during inflation of $\approx 5 \times 10^{16}$ GeV. A
stochastic background of gravitational waves from inflation could produce the
entire observed signal (consistent with the observed dipole anisotropy and a
flat spectrum) if the vacuum energy during inflation was as small as $1.5
\times 10^{16}$ GeV at the 95\% confidence level. This coincides nicely with
the mass scale for Grand Unification inferred from precision measurements of
the electroweak and strong coupling constants, for the SUSY Grand Unified
Theories. Thus COBE could be providing the first direct evidence, via
gravitational waves, for GUTs, and supersymmetry. Further tests of this
possibility are examined, based on analyzing the energy density associated with
gravitational waves from inflation.

renormalization group, the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion in the deep
Euclidean region may be expressed explicitly in terms of the perturbative
coefficients of the Minkowski space discontinuity (the $R$-ratio in $e^+ e^-$
scattering). This relation yields a ``generic'' prediction for the large-order
behavior of the Euclidean perturbation series and suggests the presence of
non-perturbative $1/q^2$ correction in the Euclidian correlation function. No
such ``generic'' prediction can be made for the physically measurable
$R$-ratio. A novel functional method is developed to obtain these results.

mass-mixing angle parameter space obtained by comparing the solar neutrino data

not unique. The results depend on the nature of neutrinos; for example, if both
$\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}$ are pseudo-Dirac, the allowed region determined by the
current solar neutrino data does not overlap with that obtained in the usual
case of pure Dirac or Majorana neutrinos.
