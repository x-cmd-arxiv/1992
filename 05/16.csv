fields is analysed. Classically, the theory has some exact solutions. These
include configurations representing black holes. A semi-classical theory is
obtained by assuming that these singular solutions are caused by the collapse
of some matter fields. The semi-classical equations of motion reveal then that
any generic solution must have a flat geometry.

the anti-ferroelectric regime. The method is based on the recent realization of
the quantum affine symmetry using vertex operators. With the aid of a boson
representation for the latter, an integral formula is found for correlation
functions of arbitrary local operators. As a special case it reproduces the
spontaneous staggered polarization obtained earlier by Baxter.

non--perturbatively stable 2D quantum gravity coupled to the $(2m-1,2)$ models
is studied. Global KdV flows between the appropriate solutions are considered
as deformations of two compatible linear problems. It is demonstrated that the
necessary conditions for such flows to exist are satisfied. A numerical study
reveals such flows between the pole--free solutions of pure gravity ($m=2$),
the Lee--Yang edge model ($m=3$) and topological gravity ($m=1$). We conjecture
that this is the case for all of the $m$--critical models. As the $m=1$
solution is unique these global flows define a {\sl unique} solution for each
$m$--critical model.
