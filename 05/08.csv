southern galactic hemispheres, and the Abell and ACO clusters distributions. We
perform a statistical (correlation and cluster) analysis of a sample of Abell
and ACO galaxy clusters in the southern galactic hemisphere. We compare these
results with a symmetric sample at northern galactic latitude taken from
Postman et al. (1992). For the northern sample, we substantially confirm the
results of Postman et al. We find that the two-point spatial correlation
function of northern and southern clusters is comparable, with mean correlation
length 19.6 Mpc and slope -1.8 positive up to about 45 Mpc. Percolation
properties are remarkably similar in the northern and southern cluster samples.
We give also a catalog of superclusters. In the south galactic hemisphere the
main feature is a very rich, extended supercluster in the Horologium region at
a redshift 0.06, near to a large void.

quarkonia are presented. They are based on a new factorization theorem which is
valid to leading order in the heavy quark velocity and to all orders in the
running coupling constant of QCD. The decay rates for all four P states into
light hadronic or electromagnetic final states are expressed in terms of two
phenomenological parameters, whose coefficients are perturbatively calculable.
Logarithms of the binding energy encountered in previous perturbative
calculations of P-wave decays are factored into a phenomenological parameter
that is related to the probability for the heavy quark-antiquark pair to be in
a color-octet S-wave state. Applying these predictions to charmonium, we use
measured decay rates for the $\chione$ and $\chitwo$ to predict the decay rates
of the $\chizero$ and $h_c$.

Since it is almost massless, its nature is more wave like than particle like.
Hence we apply quantum mechanics to study how they form the galactic halos.
Three predictions are made; (1)the mass profile $\rho\sim r^{-1.6}$, (2)there
are ripple-like fine structures in rotation curve, (3) the rotation velocity
times ripple's wave length is largely galaxy independent. We compare the
rotation curves predicted by our theory with the data observed.

back-scattering of a laser beam, this reaction is shown to be complementary to
selectron pair production in the processes $e^+e^-\to\tilde e^+\tilde e^-$ and
$e^-e^-\to\tilde e^-\tilde e^-$, and to be a probe of heavy selectrons beyond
the kinematical limit of pair production. The standard model background from
