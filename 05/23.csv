developed, based on the continuum theory presented in the preceding paper.
Special attention is given to choosing a lattice action (the ``geodesic''
action) that is appropriate for fields having noncompact curved configuration
spaces. A consistent continuum limit of the model exists only if the
renormalized scale constant $\beta_R$ vanishes for some value of the bare scale
constant~$\beta$. The geodesic action has a special form that allows direct
access to the small-$\beta$ limit. In this limit half of the degrees of freedom
can be integrated out exactly. The remaining degrees of freedom are those of a
compact model having a $\beta$-independent action which is noteworthy in being
unbounded from below yet yielding integrable averages. Both the exact action
and the $\beta$-independent action are used to obtain $\beta_R$ from Monte
Carlo computations of field-field averages (2-point functions) and
current-current averages. Many consistency cross-checks are performed. It is
found that there is no value of $\beta$ for which $\beta_R$ vanishes. This
means that as the lattice cutoff is removed the theory becomes that of a pair
of massless free fields. Because these fields have neither the geometry nor the
symmetries of the original model we conclude that the $O(1,2)/O(2)\times Z_2$
model has no continuum limit.

simulating effectively a system with a rough free energy landscape (i.e. many
coexisting states) at finite non-zero temperature. This method is related to
simulated annealing, but here the temperature becomes a dynamic variable, and
the system is always kept at equilibrium. We analyze the method on the Random
Field Ising Model, and we find a dramatic improvement over conventional
Metropolis and cluster methods. We analyze and discuss the conditions under
which the method has optimal performances.

implementations as finite transformations and to generate, classically and
infinitesimally, the full canonical algebra. A general canonical transformation
can, in principle, be realized quantum mechanically as a product of these
transformations. It is found that the intertwining of two super-Hamiltonians is
equivalent to there being a canonical transformation between them. A
consequence is that the procedure for solving a differential equation can be
viewed as a sequence of elementary canonical transformations trivializing the
super-Hamiltonian associated to the equation. It is proposed that the quantum
integrability of a system is equivalent to the existence of such a sequence.

solution is constructed by a modification of the 't Hooft ansatz for a
four-dimensional instanton. An analogous solution in Yang-Mills field theory
saturates a Bogomoln'yi bound and possesses the topology and far field limit of
a multimonopole configuration, but has divergent action near each source. In
the string solution, however, the divergences from the Yang-Mills sector are
precisely cancelled by those from the gravity sector. The resultant action is
finite and easily computed. The Manton metric on moduli space for the
scattering of two string monopoles is found to be flat to leading order in the
impact parameter, in agreement with the trivial scattering predicted by a test
monopole calculation.
