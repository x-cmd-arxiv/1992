study of the distribution of the zeros of the partition function in the complex
quark mass plane. Simulations are performed at fixed temperature on three
different spatial volumes at $\beta=5.04$ and at $\beta=4.9$ and $\beta=5.2$ on
a $4^4$ lattice. Evidence is found for a chirally related transition at
non-zero quark mass in the intermediate coupling region for $\beta < 5.2 $ but
superimposed upon a smooth behaviour for the condensate. The critical mass at
which this transition is found is only weakly dependent on the spatial volume
and decreas with decreasing temperature.

B383 (1992) 497-524","10.1016/0550-3213(92)90086-Q",,"hep-ph",,"  The interface tension between Z(N) vacua in a hot SU(N) gauge theory (without
dynamical fermions) is computed at next to leading order in weak coupling. The
Z(N) interface tension is related to the instanton of an effective action,
which includes both classical and quantum terms; a general technique for
treating consistently the saddle points of such effective actions is developed.
Loop integrals which arise in the calculation are evaluated by means of zeta
function techniques. As a byproduct, up to two loop order we find that the
stable vacuum is always equivalent to the trivial one, and so respects charge
conjugation symmetry.

values of Chern-Simons graphs fails to determine certain crucial signs. The
step which involves calculating tetrahedra by solving certain non- linear
equations is repaired by introducing additional linear equations. As a first
step towards a new algorithm for general graphs we find useful linear equations
for those special graphs which support knots and links. Using the improved set
of equations for tetrahedra we examine the symmetries between tetrahedra
generated by arbitrary simple currents. Along the way we uncover the classical
origin of simple-current charges. The improved skein relations also lead to
exact identities between planar tetrahedra in level $K$ $G(N)$ and level $N$
$G(K)$ CS theories, where $G(N)$ denotes a classical group. These results are
recast as identities for quantum $6j$-symbols and WZW braid matrices. We obtain
the transformation properties of arbitrary graphs and links under simple
current symmetries and rank-level duality. For links with knotted components
this requires precise control of the braid eigenvalue permutation signs, which
we obtain from plethysm and an explicit expression for the (multiplicity free)
signs, valid for all compact gauge groups and all fusion products.
