three-dimensional quantum gravity based on a summation over dynamical
triangulations. These were done both in the microcanonical ensemble, with the
number of points in the triangulation and the number of Ising spins fixed, and
in the grand canoncal ensemble. We have investigated the two possible cases of
the spins living on the vertices of the triangulation (``diect'' case) and the
spins living in the middle of the tetrahedra (``dual'' case). We observed phase
transitions which are probably second order, and found that the dual
implementation more effectively couples the spins to the quantum gravity.
