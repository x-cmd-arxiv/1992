expectation values of operators that do not commute with the Hamiltonian and
for differences between eigenvalues of different Hamiltonians. The integral
representations of the Schroedinger equations are transformed into two
equations whose solution has the form $\psi_a(x) t(x,y) \psi_b(y)$, where
$\psi_a$ and $\psi_b$ are the wavefunctions for the two related systems and
$t(x,y)$ is a kernel chosen to couple $x$ and $y$. The Monte Carlo process,
with random walkers on the enlarged configuration space $x \otimes y$, solves
these equations by generating densities whose asymptotic form is the above
bilinear distribution. With such a distribution, exact Monte Carlo estimators
can be obtained for the expectation values of quantum operators and for energy
differences. We present results of these methods applied to several test
problems, including a model integral equation, and the hydrogen atom.

at intermediate values of the Yukawa coupling $y$ when the nearest neighbour
coupling $\kp$ of the scalar field $\Phi$ is very weakly ferromagnetic ($\kp
\approx 0$) or even antiferromagnetic ($\kappa < 0$) and the nonvanishing value
of $\vev$ is generated by the Yukawa interaction. The renormalized Yukawa
coupling $y_R$ achieves here its maximal value and this $y$-region is thus of
particular importance for lattice investigations of strong Yukawa interaction.
However, here the scalar field propagators have a very complex structure caused
by fermion loop corrections and by the proximity of phases with
antiferromagnetic properties. We develop methods for analyzing these
propagators and for extracting the physical observables. We find that going
into the negative $\kp$ region, the scalar field renormalization constant
becomes small and $y_R$ does not seem to exceed the unitarity bound, making the
existence of a nontrivial fixed point in the investigated Yukawa model quite
unlikely.
