equation is examined through numerical and analytic methods. Dynamic scaling
relationships are developed for the collective ordering of convective rolls in
the limit of infinite aspect ratio. The stationary solutions are shown to be
strongly influenced by the strength of noise. Stationary states for small and
large noise strengths appear to be quasi-ordered and disordered respectively.
The dynamics of ordering from an initially inhomogeneous state is very slow in
the former case and fast in the latter. Both numerical and analytic
calculations indicate that the slow dynamics can be characterized by a simple
scaling relationship, with a characteristic dynamic exponent of $1/4$ in the
intermediate time regime.

gauge theory of generalized projective connections. This leads to projective
field theory. The possible anomalies arising at the quantum level are analyzed
by solving Wess-Zumino consistency conditions. The implications for induced

$\mu$ as the unique measure of maximal entropy. Then we show that the measure
$\mu$ has a local product structure and that the currents $\mu^\pm$ have a
laminar structure. This allows us to deduce information about periodic points
