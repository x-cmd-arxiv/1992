electrons is calculated for a quasi-one-dimensional conductor exposed to a
magnetic field perpendicular to the chains. It is found that specific heat,
magnetization and torque oscillate when the magnetic field is rotated in the
plane perpendicular to the chains or when the magnitude of magnetic filed is
changed. This new mechanism of thermodynamic magnetic oscillations in metals,
which is not related to the presence of any closed electron orbits, is applied
to explain behavior of the organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$.

density-wave instabilities, are solved for a three-dimensional isotropic metal
in a high magnetic field when only the lowest Landau level is filled. In the
case of a repulsive interaction between electrons, a phase transition to the
density-wave state is found at finite temperature. In the opposite case of
attractive interaction, no phase transition is found. With decreasing
temperature $T$, the effective vertex of interaction between electrons
renormalizes toward a one-dimensional limit in a self-similar way with the
characteristic length (transverse to the magnetic field) decreasing as
$\ln^{-1/6}(\omega_c/T)$ ($\omega_c$ is a cutoff). Correlation functions have
new forms, previously unknown for conventional one-dimensional or
three-dimensional Fermi-liquids.

neutral currents are suppressed by an approximate chiral symmetry of the
low-energy lagrangian. This symmetry allows the derivation of general relations
among low-energy flavour-changing processes. We derive one such: the relative
sizes of the decay rates b --> s gamma, b --> d gamma and s --> d gamma.
Together with a unitarity-related lower bound on the rate for the
strangeness-changing hyperon decay Omega^- --> Xi^- \gamma we obtain a
reasonably model-independent lower bound for the inclusive b --> s gamma rate.

current algebra (or gauged WZW) coset models of strings and particles
propagating in curved space-time. The simplest case is the 2d black hole. In
higher dimensions these geometries describe new and much more complex
singularities. For string and particle theories (defined in the text) we
introduce general methods for identifying global coordinates and give the
general exact solution for the geodesics for any gauged WZW model for any
number of dimensions. We then specialize to the 3d geometries associated with
$SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$ (and also $SO(3,1)/SO(2,1)$) and discuss in detail the global
space, geodesics, curvature singularities and duality properties of this space.
The large-small (or mirror) type duality property is reformulated as an
inversion in group parameter space. The 3d global space has two topologically
distinct sectors, with patches of different sectors related by duality. The
first sector has a singularity surface with the topology of ``pinched double
trousers"". It can be pictured as the world sheet of two closed strings that
join into a single closed string and then split into two closed strings, but
with a pinch in each leg of the trousers. The second sector has a singularity
surface with the topology of ``double saddle"", pictured as the world sheets of
two infinite open strings that come close but do not touch. We discuss the
geodesicaly complete spaces on each side of these surfaces and interpret the
motion of particles in physical terms. A cosmological interpretation is
suggested and comments are mode on possible physical applications.

differential geometry on quantum groups, etc. We study two forms of spectral
parameter independent reflection equations, chosen by the requirement that
their solutions be comodules with respect to the quantum group coaction leaving
invariant the reflection equations. For a variety of known solutions of the

equations. Various quadratic algebras defined by the reflection equations are
