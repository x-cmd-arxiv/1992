stat. mech. Recently it was solved for the impenetrable Bose Gas. The idea is
to represent correlation function as $\tau$ function of calssical completely
integrable differential equation. Now we start to apply this program to
isotropic XY model in the trasnsverse magnetic field. In this paper we are
making first step. We representing correlation function as detrminanat of an
integral operator.
