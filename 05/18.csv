- dimensional target space metric having a null Killing vector. It is shown
that the model is finite to all orders of the loop expansion if the dependence
of the ``transverse"" part of the metric $\ggij (u,x)$ on the light cone
coordinate $u$ is subject to the standard renormalization group equation of the
$N$ - dimensional sigma model, $ {d\ggij\over du} = \gb_{ij} =R_{ij} + ... $.
In particular, we discuss the `one - coupling' case when $\ggij(u,x)$ is a
metric of an $N$ - dimensional symmetric space $\gij(x)$ multiplied by a
function $f(u)$. The theory is finite if $f(u)$ is equal to the ``running""
coupling of the symmetric space sigma model (with $u$ playing the role of the
RG ``time""). For example, the geometry of space - time with $\gij$ being the
metric of the $N$ - sphere is determined by the form of the $\gb$ - function of
the $O(N+1)$ model. The ``asymptotic freedom"" limit of large $u$ corresponds to
the weak coupling limit of small $2+N$ - dimensional curvature. We prove that
there exists a dilaton field which together with the $2+N$ - dimensional metric
solves the sigma model Weyl invariance conditions. The resulting backgrounds
thus represent new tree level string vacua. We also remark on possible
connections with some $2d$ quantum gravity models.

invariant potential for the compactification radius $T$, arising in a class of
superstring vacua. We show that in spite of having only one minimum in the
fundamental domain of the $T$ field there are two types of non-supersymmetric
domain walls: one is associated with the discrete Peccei-Quinn symmetry $T\to
T+i$, analogous to the axionic domain wall, and another one associated with the
noncompact symmetry $T\to 1/T$, analogous to the $Z_2$ domain walls. The first
one is bound by stringy cosmic strings. The scale of such domain walls is
governed by the scale of gaugino condensation (${\cal O} (10^{16}$ GeV) in the
case of hidden $E_8$ gauge group), while the separation between minima is of
order $M_{pl}$. We discuss the formation of walls and their cosmological
implications: the walls must be gotten rid of, either by chopping by stringy
cosmic strings and/or inflation. Since there is no usual Kibble mechanism to
create strings, either one must assume they exist $ab initio$, or one must
conclude that string cosmologies require inflation. The non-perturbative
potential dealt with here appears not to give the needed inflationary epoch.
