"cond-mat/9205004","Dennis Clougherty","D.P. Clougherty and W. Kohn","Low Energy Behavior of Quantum Adsorption","11 pages + 1 figure (included)",,,,"cond-mat",,"  We present an exact solution of a 1D model: a particle of incident energy $E$
colliding with a target which is a 1D harmonic ``solid slab'' with $N$ atoms in
its ground state; the Hilbert space of the target is restricted to the ($N+1$)
states with zero or one phonon present. For the case of a short range
interaction, $V(z)$, between the particle and the surface atom supporting a
bound state, an explicit non-perturbative solution of the collision problem is
presented. For finite and large $N$, there is no true sticking but only
so-called Feshbach resonances. A finite sticking coefficient ${\sl s}(E)$ is
obtained by introducing a small phonon decay rate $\eta$ and letting
$N\to\infty$. Our main interest is in the behavior of ${\sl s}(E)$ as $E\to 0$.
For a short range $V(z)$, we find ${\sl s}(E)\sim E^{1/2}$, regardless of the
strength of the particle-phonon coupling. However, if $V(z)$ has a Coulomb
$z^{-1}$ tail, we find ${\sl s}(E)\to\alpha$, where $0 < \alpha < 1$. [A fully
classical calculation gives ${\sl s}(E)\to 1$ in both cases.] We conclude that
the same threshold laws apply to 3D systems of neutral and charged particles
respectively.

and the new Bern-Kosower calculational rules for gauge theory is clarified. For
one-loop effective actions of scalars, Dirac spinors, and vector bosons in a
background gauge field, Bern-Kosower-type rules are derived without the use of
either string theory or Feynman diagrams. The effective action is written as a
one-dimensional path integral, which can be calculated to any order in the
gauge coupling; evaluation leads to Feynman parameter integrals directly,
bypassing the usual algebra required from Feynman diagrams, and leading to
compact and organized expressions. This formalism is valid off-shell, is
explicitly gauge invariant, and can be extended to a number of other field
theories.

magnitude to the usual Standard Model loop corrections. Radiative corrections
to the Higgs particle masses and couplings due to heavy top-quarks are included

correct inner product on this space of states is not yet known, or in other
words, the *-algebra structure of the algebra of observables has not been
determined. In order to approach this problem, we consider a larger space H of
solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint, which has as a basis isotopy classes
of tangles. A certain algebra T, the ``tangle algebra,'' acts as operators on
H. The ``empty state'', corresponding to the class of the empty tangle, is
conjectured to be a cyclic vector for T. We construct simpler representations
of T as quotients of H by the skein relations for the HOMFLY polynomial, and
calculate a *-algebra structure for T using these representations. We use this
to determine the inner product of certain states of quantum gravity associated
to the Jones polynomial (or more precisely, Kauffman bracket).

Bogomol'nyi-type bounds can be approximated as geodesic motion on the moduli
space of static solutions. In this paper we consider the analogous issue within
the context of supersymmetric field theories. We focus our study on a class of
$N=2$ non-linear sigma models in $d=2+1$ based on an arbitrary K\""ahler target
manifold and their associated soliton or ``lump"" solutions. Using a collective
co-ordinate expansion, we construct an effective action which, upon
quantisation, describes the low-energy dynamics of the lumps. The effective
action is an $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics action with the target
manifold being the moduli space of static charge $N$ lump solutions of the
sigma model. The Hilbert space of states of the effective theory consists of
anti-holomorphic forms on the moduli space. The normalisable elements of the
dolbeault cohomology classes $H^{(0,p)}$ of the moduli space correspond to zero
energy bound states and we argue that such states correpond to bound states in
the full quantum field theory of the sigma model.
