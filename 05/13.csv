inhomogeneities in the distribution of nucleons, which in turn affect the
primordial nucleosynthesis. In all the investigations of this problem it has
been assumed that the degree of supercooling of the quark-gluon plasma after
the phase transition is large enough to produce a significant rate of
nucleation of hadrons. Using the latest results of finite temperature lattice
QCD and the finite size scaling theory, we argue that the degree of
supercooling is in fact extremely small and hence the nucleation rate is
negligible.

charged current cross sections, $R={\sigma_{NC}}/{\sigma_{CC}}$, can provide a
more sensitive probe for the existence of heavy leptoquarks at HERA than the
usual proceedure which makes use of neutral current asymmetries. The apparent
reason for this is that the Standard Model expectations for {\it both} of these
cross sections are modified by the existence of such particles in a
semi-coherent manner. In this paper we apply this technique to extended
electroweak models whose spectrum contains both a $W'$ and a $Z'$. We find that
measurements of $R$ can, for some models, substantially increase the HERA
search range for new gauge bosons beyond that which can be probed using the
more conventional asymmetries.

neutrinos and a complex $SU(2)\times U(1)$ singlet Higgs in addition to the

imposed, which on spontaneous breaking gives rise to a Goldstone boson. This
symmetry is chosen in a way that makes a) the contribution of heavy ($\leq$
  MeV) majorana neutrinos to the neutrinoless double beta decay amplitude
vanish and b) allows the heavy neutrino to decay to a lighter neutrino and the
Goldstone boson. It is shown that this decay can occur at a rate much faster
than in the original Majoron model even if one does not introduce any
additional Higgs fields as is done in the literature. Possibility of describing
the 17 keV neutrino in this minimal seesaw model is investigated. While most of
the cosmological and astrophysical constraints on the 17 keV neutrino can be
satisfied in this model, the laboratory limits coming from the neutrino
oscillations cannot be easily met. An extension which removes this inadequacy
and offers a consistent description of the 17 keV neutrino is discussed.

values of some of its charges. The corresponding bounds in case of
Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes are known to coincide with
the requirement that naked singularities be absent. Here we investigate charged
dilaton black holes in this context. We show that the extreme solutions
saturate the supersymmetry bound of $N=4\ d=4$ supergravity, or dimensionally
reduced superstring theory. Specifically, we have shown that extreme dilaton
black holes, with electric and magnetic charges, admit super-covariantly
constant spinors. The supersymmetric positivity bound for dilaton black holes,
$M \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}(|Q|+|P|)$, takes care of the absence of naked
singularities of the dilaton black holes and is, in this sense, equivalent to
the cosmic censorship condition. The temperature, entropy and singularity are
discussed. The Euclidean action (entropy) of the extreme black hole is given by
$2\pi |PQ|$. We argue that this result, as well as the one for Lorentzian
signature, is not altered by higher order corrections in the supersymmetric
theory. When a black hole reaches its extreme limit, it cannot continue to
evaporate by emitting elementary particles, since this would violate the
supersymmetric positivity bound. We speculate on the possibility that an
extreme black hole may ``evaporate"" by emitting smaller extreme black holes.

equations were subsequently used to show that an incoming matter wave develops
a black hole type singularity at a critical value $\phi_{cr}$ of the dilaton
field. In this paper a modification to these equations arising from the
Fadeev-Popov determinant is considered and shown to have dramatic effects for
$N<24$, in which case $\phi_{cr}$ becomes complex. The $N<24$ equations are
solved along the leading edge of an incoming matter shock wave and found to be
non-singular. The shock wave arrives at future null infinity in a zero energy
state, gravitationally cloaked by negative energy Hawking radiation. Static
black hole solutions supported by a radiation bath are also studied. The
interior of the event horizon is found to be non-singular and asymptotic to
deSitter space for $N<24$, at least for sufficiently small mass. It is noted
that the one-loop approximation is {\it not} justified by a small parameter for
small $N$. However an alternate theory (with different matter content) is found
for which the same equations arise to leading order in an adjustable small
parameter.
