naturally on the d-dimensional projective space P^d parametrizing
configurations (`d-tuples') of points on the line. In this note we are
concerned with the orbits of this action of PGL(2) on P^d. The closure of each
orbit is a projective subvariety of P^d of which we determine the degree, the
`boundary'--i.e., the complement of an orbit in its closure--, and the
multiplicity at points of the boundary. These results are used to provide a
complete classification of the non-singular orbit closures, and criteria for an
orbit closure to be non-singular in codimension 1.

  pages. Uuencoded compressed tar figures file. Revised and augmented version
  of hep-ph/9205215",,,"PAR-LPTHE 92/14","hep-ph hep-th",,"  We show, in the case of a U(1)L spontaneously broken gauge theory, how
introducing a composite Wess-Zumino field, with a derivative coupling to the
fermionic current, and a composite scalar sector leads to infinitely massive
quarks and Higgs boson, making them unobservable as asymptotic states. This
results from the constraints that need to be introduced in the Feynman path
integral to take into account the non-independent scalar degrees of freedom,
and from the breaking of the symmetry by the non-vanishing vacuum expectation
value of the Higgs boson. Unitarity and gauge invariance are achieved; the
former can be made explicit by ""gauging"" the Wess-Zumino field into the third
component of the massive gauge boson; the latter is recovered at the level of
Green functions through the cancellation of the non-invariance of the action
with that of the fermionic measure. The compensation of the anomaly can also be
seen as a consequence of the infinite mass of the fermions. The pseudoscalar
partner of the Higgs is shown to behave like an abelian pion, specially as far
are its leptonic decays are concerned; in particular, no extra scale of
interaction is needed, unlike in ""technicolour"" theories. The correct decay of
the pion into two photons is recovered despite the abscence of anomaly.
Arguments are given in favour of renormalizability. The leptonic sector is the
object of a subsequent work.

energy is carried by a single black hole. Schwarzschild black holes are found
to obey the statistical bootstrap condition. In all cases, the microcanonical
temperature is identical to the Hawking temperature of the most massive black
hole in the gas. U(1) charges in general break the bootstrap property. The
problems of black hole decay and of quantum coherence are also addressed.

universe'' in Euclidean quantum gravity, two important approximations are made:
the path integral is evaluated in a saddle point approximation, and only the
leading (least action) extremum is taken into account. In (2+1)-dimensional
gravity with a negative cosmological constant, the second assumption is shown
to lead to incorrect results: although the leading extremum gives the most
important single contribution to the path integral, topologically inequivalent
instantons with larger actions occur in great enough numbers to predominate.
One can thus say that in 2+1 dimensions --- and possibly in 3+1 dimensions as
well --- entropy dominates action in the gravitational path integral.

states are neutral string excitations massive already in ten dimensions and the
one in which their masses (and charges) originate in the process of
compactification on tori. A perturbative calculation based on superstring
amplitudes gives us the deflection angle up to the second order in Newton's
constant. A comparison with field theory explicitly shows which among the
various massless fields of the superstring give a contribution to the
scattering process. In both cases, the deflection angle is smaller than the one
computed in general relativity. The perturbative series can be resummed by
finding the exact solution to the classical equations of motion of the
corresponding low-energy action. The space-time metric of our two examples of
string stars has no horizon.

series, in powers of derivatives along the worldsheet. Transformations that act
on the direction transverse to the string worldsheet involve a universal
dimension $-1$ term. As a consequence, Lorentz invariance holds in this theory
of long effective strings due to cancellations in the action between irrelevant
terms and the dimension two term that describes free massless scalar fields in
two dimensions. (in plain tex, no macropackages necessary)
