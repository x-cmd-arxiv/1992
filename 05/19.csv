"funct-an/9205003","Vladimir Pestov","Vladimir G. Pestov","Nonstandard hulls of Banach-Lie groups and algebras","12 pages",,,,"funct-an math.OA",,"  We propose a new construction of Banach-Lie groups and algebras relying on
nonstandard analysis. A major standard application is the Local Theorem which
to certain extent reduces the problem of associating a Lie group to a given
banach-Lie algebra to a similar problem for finitely generated Lie subalgebras.
We discuss possible applications, e.g., to gauge theories.

measured in a cylindrical geometry on finite lattices. By comparing to exact
results in the two dimensional Ising model we demonstrate that $E_{0a}$ can be
extracted very reliably from Monte Carlo calculations in practice. In four
dimensions we compare the measured $E_{0a}$ with two different theoretical
predictions on the finite size behavior of the energy splitting. We find that
our numerical data are in favor of the predictions based on the semiclassical
dilute instanton gas approximation.

theory, give a large entropy production during the matter era. The subsequent
axion dilution is proportional to their present energy density. Depending on
the parameters ($\beta_I,\beta_V$) of the model, this dilution relaxes or even
eludes the cosmological bound on the axion mass, therefore opening the
so--called ``axion window"".

quantization of the degrees of freedom of the gravitational field.

  Instructions included. Uncompressed version available from author",,,,"hep-th",,"  This thesis is a study of two dimensional noncritical string theory. The main
tool which is used, is the matrix model. Introductions to both the Liouville
model and its matrix model formulation are included. In particular the special
states are discussed. Some calculations of partition functions on genus one
using field theory techniques are given. Nonperturbative issues and string
theory at finite radius are discussed. Zero momentum correlation functions are
calculated using the matrix model. One important result is a set of recursion
relations. The treatment is extended to nonzero momentum. The main result is a
clear identification of the special states. Some comments on the Wheeler de
Witt equation is given. The matrix model $W_{\infty}$ algebra is introduced.
This organizes the previous results. In particular, a simple derivation of the
genus zero tachyon correlation functions is given. The results are then
extended to higher genus. It is seen how a deformation of the algebra is
responsible for much of the higher genus structure. Some very explicit formulae
are derived. Then the Liouville and matrix model calculations are compared
followed by some general conclusions.

$\widetilde H(\Lambda)$. Our techniques provide evidence for the existence of
several new theories beyond those proven to exist in previous work and
conjectured to exist in Schellekens and Yankielowicz.
