non-leptonic exclusive decays of the type $B\rightarrow D\pi$ ($N_c$ is the
number of colors). In a certain kinematical limit rather reliable estimates are
possible. It is demonstrated that the nonfactorizable parts are of the same
order as the factorizable $1/N_c$ parts of the ampiltudes, and have the
opposite sign. Thus, an approximate rule of discarding $1/N_c$ corrections in
the nonleptonic exclusive decays emerges dynamically. It is shown that this
rule is not exact and the degree of compensation is different in different
channels.
  Our predictions make use of the fact that a key matrix element that measures
deviations from factorization can be determined using the heavy quark effective
theory.

experimental constraint lowers the current upper bound on the ordinary - mirror

production at HERA undetectably small. A way out is to allow for different
mixing angles of the L and R field components. Choosing very small right mixing
angles compatibility with the anomalous magnetic moment measurement may be
easily maintained, while choosing left mixing angles close to the upper limits
yields still reasonable HERA cross-sections.
