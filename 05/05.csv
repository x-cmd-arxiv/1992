the paper is to outline in the last section an ``equivariant'' approach to some
key results in the theory of toric varieties. The text of the first three
sections follows closely a talk delivered at the University of Copenhagen in
July 1989 on the occasion of the Zeuthen Symposium. This paper is dedicated to

process acting on randomly scrambled magnetic flux arches above an accretion
disc. The accelerated protons collide with thermal protons in the disc,
producing degraded energetic protons, charged and neutral pions, and neutrons.
The pions produce gamma-rays by spontaneous decay of $\pi^0$ and by
bremsstrahlung and Compton processes following the decay of $\pi^\pm$ to
$e^\pm$.

based on a Wolff-type embedding of Ising spins into the target manifold $M$. We
argue heuristically that, at least for an asymptotically free model, such an
algorithm can have dynamic critical exponent $z \ll 2$ only if the embedding is
based on an (involutive) isometry of $M$ whose fixed-point manifold has
codimension 1. Such an isometry exists only if the manifold is a discrete
quotient of a product of spheres. Numerical simulations of the idealized
codimension-2 algorithm for the two-dimensional $O(4)$-symmetric $\sigma$-model
yield $z_{int,{\cal M}^2} = 1.5 \pm 0.5$ (subjective 68\% confidence interval),
in agreement with our heuristic argument.

partial cross sections of the energy and angular distribution of the outgoing

that electron-photon collider experiments could be quite sensitive to the

not violated by quantum gravity. We show that four dimensional CP can arise as
a discrete gauge symmetry in theories with dimensional compactification, if the
original number of Minkowski dimensions equals $8k+1$, $8k+2$ or $8k+3$, and if
there are certain restrictions on the gauge group; these conditions are met by
superstrings. CP may then be broken spontaneously below $10^9$ GeV, explaining
the observed CP violation in the kaon system without inducing a large EDMN. We
discuss the phenomenology of such models, as well as the peculiar nature of
cosmic ``CP strings'' which could be produced at the compactification scale.
Such strings have the curious property that a particle carried around the
string is turned into its CP conjugate. A single CP string renders four
dimensional spacetime nonorientable.

treated explicitly. Electroweak symmetry is broken by the condensates of a
`minimal' doublet of technifermions. The new feature of the model is that the
the third generation quarks are unified with the technifermions into multiplets
of a walking gauge force down to a scale of $10$ TeV. The remaining quarks and
leptons are not involved in this unification however. The walking dynamics
enhances the higher dimension interactions which give the ordinary fermions
their masses and mixing, while leaving flavor-changing neutral currents
suppressed. Because the third generation quarks actually feel the walking force
their masses can be much larger than those of the other quarks and the leptons.
The only non-standard particles with masses below several TeV are the single
doublet of technifermions, so electroweak radiative corrections are estimable
and within experimental limits.

""composite technicolor"" (CTC) models. In order for these models to work, an
""ultrafermion"" condensate must align in a particular way, driven by the
competition between ultrafermion masses and ""flavor"" gauge boson exchange. We
show that for ultrafermion masses large enough to explain the top quark mass,
order-of-magnitude estimates are sufficient to establish that the required
vacuum alignment cannot occur for perturbative values of the flavor gauge
couplings. If the top quark gets its mass from some other mechanism, a detailed
calculation is required. Using spectral function sum rules and a vector-meson
saturation approximation which is known to work well in QCD, we determine the
correct vacuum for this case in a limit where the flavor gauge bosons are
weakly coupled and the number of ultracolors $N$ is large. We again find that
the vacuum required by CTC models does not occur for perturbative values of the
flavor gauge couplings. We conclude that there is no evidence that the vacuum
aligns as required in CTC models.

""fifth-time"" stabilized quantum gravity is equivalent to Langevin evolution
(i.e. stochastic quantization) between fixed non-singular, but otherwise
arbitrary, initial and final states. The simple restriction to a fixed final
state at $t_5 \rightarrow \infty$ is sufficient to stabilize the theory. This
equivalence fixes the integration measure, and suggests a particular
operator-ordering, for the fifth-time action of quantum gravity. Results of a
numerical simulation of stabilized, latticized Einstein-Cartan theory on some
small lattices are reported. In the range of cosmological constant $\l$
investigated, it is found that: 1) the system is always in the broken phase
$<det(e)> \ne 0$; and 2) the negative free energy is large, possibly singular,
in the vincinity of $\l = 0$. The second finding may be relevant to the
cosmological constant problem.
