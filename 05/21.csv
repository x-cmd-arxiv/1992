two-dimensional array of quenched random impurities. The string is driven by a
constant transverse force and thermal fluctuations are neglected. There is a
transition from pinned to unpinned behavior at a critical value $F_T$ of the
driving force. At the transition the average string velocity scales with the
driving force. The scaling is equally well described by a power law $v_d\sim
(F-F_T)^\zeta$, with $\zeta=0.24\pm0.1$, or by a logarithm,
$v_d\sim1/\ln(F-F_T)$. The divergence of the velocity-velocity correlation
length at threshold is characterized by an exponent $\nu=1.05\pm0.1$.

is examined. Hops by localized modes over small barriers trigger
``avalanches'', resulting in a creep velocity much larger than that expected
from comparing thermal energies with typical barriers. For a field equal to the
$T=0$ depinning field, the creep velocity is predicted to have a {\em
power-law} dependence on the temperature $T$; numerical computations confirm
this result. The predicted order of magnitude of the thermal rounding of the
depinning transition is consistent with rounding seen in experiment.

space $O(1,2)/O(2)\times Z_2$ is similar to quantum gravity in being
perturbatively nonrenormalizable and having a noncompact curved configuration
space. It is therefore a good model for testing nonperturbative methods that
may be useful in quantum gravity, especially methods based on lattice field
theory. In this paper we develop the theoretical framework necessary for
recognizing and studying a consistent nonperturbative quantum field theory of
the $O(1,2)/O(2)\times Z_2$ model. We describe the action, the geometry of the
configuration space, the conserved Noether currents, and the current algebra,
and we construct a version of the Ward-Slavnov identity that makes it easy to
switch from a given field to a nonlinearly related one. Renormalization of the
model is defined via the effective action and via current algebra. The two
definitions are shown to be equivalent. In a companion paper we develop a
lattice formulation of the theory that is particularly well suited to the sigma
model, and we report the results of Monte Carlo simulations of this lattice
model. These simulations indicate that as the lattice cutoff is removed the
theory becomes that of a pair of massless free fields. Because the geometry and
symmetries of these fields differ from those of the original model we conclude
that a continuum limit of the $O(1,2)/O(2)\times Z_2$ model which preserves
these properties does not exist.

decay constant to the vector meson mass is roughly independent of quark mass as
observed experimentally, and in approximate agreement with the measured value.

of the naturalness problems of hidden sector supergravity models. We review the
argument that in a generic supergravity theory in which supersymmetry is {\it
dynamically} broken in the hidden sector, only tiny Majorana masses for
gauginos are generated. This situation is similar to that of theories with
continuous R-symmetries, for which Hall and Randall have suggested that gluino
masses could arise through mixings with an octet of chiral fields. We note that
in hidden sector models, such mixing can only occur if the auxiliary D field of
a $U(1)$ gauge field has an expectation value. This in turn gives rise to a
catastrophically large Fayet-Iliopoulos term for ordinary hypercharge. To solve
this problem it is necessary to unify hypercharge at least partially in a
non-Abelian group. We consider, also, some general issues in models with
continuous or discrete R symmetries, noting that it may be necessary to include
$SU(2)$ triplet fields, and that these are subject to various constraints. In
the course of these discussions, we consider a number of naturalness problems.
We suggest that the so-called ``$\mu$-problem"" is not a problem, and point out
that in models in which the axion decay constant is directly related to the
SUSY breaking scale, squarks, sleptons and Higgs particles generically acquire
huge masses.

action. As in a previous work, our approach does not involve choice of gauge or
clever manipulations of functional integrals. Instead, we just require the
Gauss law constraint for gravity to be first class and also to be everywhere
differentiable. When the spatial slice is a disc, the gravitational fields can
either be unconstrained or constrained at the boundary of the disc. The
unconstrained fields correspond to edge currents which carry a representation
of the $ISO(2,1)$ Kac-Moody algebra. Unitary representations for such an
algebra have been found using the method of induced representations. In the
case of constrained fields, we can classify all possible boundary conditions.
For several different boundary conditions, the field content of the theory
reduces precisely to that of 1+1 dimensional gravity theories. We extend the
above formalism to include sources. The sources take into account self-
interactions. This is done by punching holes in the disc, and erecting an
$ISO(2,1)$ Kac-Moody algebra on the boundary of each hole. If the hole is
originally sourceless, a source can be created via the action of a vertex
operator $V$. We give an explicit expression for $V$. We shall show that when
