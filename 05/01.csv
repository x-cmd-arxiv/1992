supernovae. The effects of asymmetries, extinction, and flux dilution are
explored. Using empirical evidence and time-independent, spherical models which
treat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux
dilution are small for type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical
when their color temperatures are less than 6000~K. The extinction to a type
II-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty
introduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than
10\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution we derive distances to 10
supernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN
1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide
range, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc, which is unique among the methods for establishing
the extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M101
and SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from
Cepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +- 3 Mpc, is
larger than recent distances estimates made using surface brightness
fluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher
method. Using the distances determined from these type II supernovae we derive
a value of $H_0 = 60 \pm 10$ km sec$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is subject to
errors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow, but will soon be improved
by applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant type II
supernovae.

density, such as gamma-ray burst source regions, using a discrete ordinate,
discrete energy group method. The calculations include two-photon pair
production and annihilation, as well as three-photon pair annihilation. The
radiation field itself acts as an absorbing medium, and the optical depth
depends on its intensity, so the problem is intrinsically nonlinear. Spherical
divergence produces effective collimation of the flux. At high optical depth
the high energy ($E > 1$ MeV) portion of the emergent spectrum assumes a nearly
universal form. An approximate limit is derived for the high energy flux from a
gamma-ray burst source region of given size, and the implications of this limit
for the distance to the March 5, 1979 event are briefly discussed. We discuss
more generally the problem of very luminous bursts, and implications of
Galactic halo distances for flare models.

by the diluted nova radiation field rather than the gas kinetic temperature,

calculate the growth of carbon nuclei in these ejecta. For expected values of
the parameters too many clusters grew, despite the small sticking probability
of atoms to small clusters, and the clusters only reached radii of about
100\AA\ when the carbon vapor was depleted. We then included the effects of
cluster photodissociation by ultraviolet radiation from the nova. This
suppresses nucleation, but too well, and no grains form at all. Finally we
suggest that a few growing carbon nuclei may be protected from
photodissociation by a sacrificial surface layer of hydrogen.

transfer, $1/\tau_D$, between two electron systems in parallel layers is
determined by setting up two coupled Boltzmann equations, with the boundary
condition that no current flows in the layer where an induced voltage is
measured. The effective Coulomb interaction between the layers is determined
selfconsistently, allowing for the finite thickness of the layers. As
$T\rightarrow 0$, we find that $1/\tau_DT^2$ approaches a constant value. At
higher temperatures $1/\tau_DT^2$ exhibits a maximum at $T=T_{\rm max}$ and
then decreases as $1/T$ with increasing temperature. The value of $T_{\rm max}$
depends on the layer separation $d$ according to $T_{\rm max}\propto
d^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha\simeq 0.8$. The overall magnitude of the calculated
$1/\tau_D$ is approximately one half of the results of a recent experiment,
suggesting that other mechanisms of momentum transfer may be important.

Villain and Vilfan (Europhys. Lett. 12, p. 523 (1990) and Surf. Sci. 257, p.

formation of anisotropic steps traversing the entire length of the crystal. The
model is studied by a mapping to a spin--1/2 Fermion system in 1+1 dimensions,
which, in the absence of islands, is precisely the Hubbard model. We consider a
general $\pbyo$ reconstruction, in the presence of inter--step interactions and
closed islands. Our analysis predicts the existence of a new type of rough
phase, with incommensurate correlations in the reconstruction order parameter
and unusual momentum space singularities at a characteristic ``Fermi momentum''
and its harmonics, analagous to the Luttinger liquid of one--dimensional
Fermions. The general phase structure for $p>1$ is as follows: for $p>2$, there
is a flat ordered (FO), a rough incommensurate (RI), and a flat incommensurate
phase (FI). The FO--RI and FO--FI transitions are of the commensurate to
incommensurate type, and the FI--RI transition is in the Kosterlitz--Thouless
(KT) universality class. For $p=2$, the FI phase is replaced by a flat
disordered phase (FD), and there may be a new rough disordered phase (RD). The
FO--FD transition is now of Ising type, and the FD--RD and RI--RD transitions
are in the KT universality class.

obtaining the high energy behavior of a two particle forward scattering
amplitude. Reliability depends on the spin of the exchanged field. For scalar
fields the eikonal fails at eighth order in perturbation theory, when it misses
the leading behavior of the exchange-type diagrams. In a vector theory the
eikonal gets the exchange diagrams correctly, but fails by ignoring certain
non-exchange graphs which dominate the asymptotic behavior of the full
amplitude. For spin--2 tensor fields the eikonal captures the leading behavior
of each order in perturbation theory, but the sum of eikonal terms is
subdominant to graphs neglected by the approximation. We also comment on the
eikonal for Yang-Mills vector exchange, where the additional complexities of
the non-abelian theory may be absorbed into Regge-type modifications of the
gauge boson propagators.

course and joint textbook, ""Concrete Mathematics"". The first of these,
extending an idea of Iverson, is the notation ""[P]"" for the function which is 1
when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This notation can
encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas
in sums and integrals.
  The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial
coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in
parentheses and read ""n choose k"", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be
written on two lines in brackets and read ""n cycle k"", while Stirling numbers
of the second kind should be written in braces and read ""n subset k"". (I might
say ""n partition k"".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The
virtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear
in combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations
similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.
