C_{70} molecules, and solve numerically. The calculations of the undoped
systems agree well with the known results. When the system (C_{60} or C_{70})
is doped with one or two electrons (or holes), the additional charges
accumulate almost along an equatorial line of the molecule. The dimerization
becomes weaker almost along the same line. Two energy levels intrude largely in
the gap. The intrusion is larger in C_{70} than in C_{60}. Therefore,
``polarons'' are predicted in doped buckminster- fullerenes. We calculate
optical absorption coefficient for C_{60} in order to look at how ``polarons''
will be observed. It is predicted that there appears a new peak at the lower
energy than the intergap transition peaks. It is also found that C_{60} and
C_{70} are related mutually with respect to electronical structures as well as
lattice geometries. (to be published in Phys. Rev. B 45, June 15 issue)

the 2D Hubbard model as a function of the hole chemical potential. The grand
canonical partition function for the model is obtained via Monte Carlo
simulations. The dependence of the hole occupation number on the chemical
potential and the temperature is evaluated. These calculations, together with a
study of the Yang-Lee zeros of the grand canonical partition function, show
evidence of a phase transition at zero temperature and particle density below
half-filling. The binding energy of a pair of holes is calculated in the low
temperature regime and the possibility for pairing is explored.

to the one-loop N-graviton scattering amplitude in the type-II superstring
theory is presented. The apparent divergence of the $N=5$ amplitude is resolved
by separating it into twelve independent terms corresponding to different
orders of inserting the graviton vertex operators. Each term is well defined in
an appropriate kinematic region and can be analytically continued to physical
regions where it develops branch cuts required by unitarity. The zero-slope
limit of the $N=5$ amplitude is performed, and the Feynman diagram content of
the low-energy field theory is examined. Both one-particle irreducible (1PI)
and one-particle redicible (1PR) graphs with massless internal states are
generated in this limit. One set of 1PI graphs has the same divergent
dependence on the cut-off as that found in the four-graviton case, and it is
proved that such graphs exist for all~$N$. The 1PR graphs are contributed by
the poles in the world-sheet chiral Green functions.
