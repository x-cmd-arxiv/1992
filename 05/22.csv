"alg-geom/9205007","Subhashis Nag","Subhashis Nag","On the Tangent Space to the Universal Teichmuller Space","25 pages. latex paper",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We find a remarkably simple relationship between the following two models of
the tangent space to the Universal Teichm\""uller Space: (1) The real-analytic
model consisting of Zygmund class vector fields on the unit circle; (2) The
complex-analytic model comprising 1-parameter families of schlicht functions on
the exterior of the unit disc which allow quasiconformal extension. Indeed, the
Fourier coefficients of the vector field in (1) turn out to be essentially the
same as (the first variations of) the corresponding power series coefficients
in (2). These identities have many applications; in particular, to conformal
welding, to the almost complex structure of Teichm\""uller space, to study of
the Weil-Petersson metric, to variational formulas for period matrices, etc.
These utilities are explored.

velocity and a residual momentum, there is redundancy in the theory: small
shifts in velocity may be absorbed into a redefinition of the residual
momentum. We demonstrate that this trivial reparameterisation invariance has
non-trivial consequences: it relates coefficients of terms of different orders
in the $1/m$ expansion and requires linear combinations of these operators to
be multiplicatively renormalised. For example, the operator $-D^2/2m$ in the
effective lagrangian has zero anomalous dimension, coefficient one, and does
not receive any non-perturbative contributions from matching conditions. We
also demonstrate that this invariance severely restricts the forms of operators
which may appear in chiral lagrangians for heavy particles.

small as a few keV but also as large as the gravitino mass. Estimates of this

been performed.

attention given to the duality between contributions from different channels.
We give a simple example of the equivalence between amplitudes coming from
string theory and quantum field theory, and compute the general form of a
four-scalar field theoretical amplitude. The corresponding string theory
calculation is performed for a special case, and we discuss how more general
string theory amplitudes could be evaluated.
