  Dimensional Fractional QHE","14 pages",,,,"cond-mat",,"  The 3D state of strongly correlated electrons is proposed, which in the
external magnetic field $\vec B$ exhibits the fractional quantum Hall effect,
with the zero temperature conductivity tensor $\sigma_{ij} = (e^2/h)(1/m)
\sum_k \epsilon_{ijk} B^k/\mid \vec B\mid $. The analog of Landau and Laughlin
states in 3D are given using quaternion coordinates as generalization of
complex coordinates. We discuss the notion of the fractional statistics in 3D
introduced recently by Haldane.

theorem, in order to establish the closure of reachable sets and the existence
of optimal trajectories for control systems, without the usual convexity
assumptions. The bang-bang property is proved for a new class of ``concave""
multifunctions, characterized by the existence of suitable linear selections.
The proofs rely on Lyapunov's theorem in connection with a Baire category
argument.

Rev Letters on the impossibility of spontaneous R Parity breaking. Apart from
explaining their error we summarize the results of a more detailed work that
demonstrates explicitly that R parity can break spontaneously at a scale
anywhere in the range 10 GeV to 1 Tev in a simple extension of the minimal SUSY
standard model proposed previously.

$\lambda$ to itself, one can combine them to obtain another such embedding in
two ways: by composition, and by applying one to (initial segments of) the
other. Hence, a single such nontrivial embedding $j$ generates an algebra of
embeddings via these two operations, which satisfies certain laws (for example,
application distributes over both composition and application). Laver has
shown, among other things, that this algebra is free on one generator with
respect to these laws.
  The set of critical points of members of this algebra is the subject of this
paper. This set contains the critical point $\kappa_0$ of $j$, as well as all
of the other ordinals $\kappa_n$ in the critical sequence of $j$ (defined by
$\kappa_{n+1} = j(\kappa_n)$). But the set includes many other ordinals as
well. The main result of this paper is that the number of critical points below
$\kappa_n$ (which has been shown to be finite by Laver and Steel) grows so
quickly with $n$ that it dominates any primitive recursive function. In fact,
it grows faster than the Ackermann function, and even faster than a slow
iterate of the Ackermann function. Further results show that, even just below
$\kappa_4$, one can find so many critical points that the number is only
expressible using fast-growing hierarchies of iterated functions (six levels of
iteration beyond exponentials).
