This enables us to find a natural generalization of the {\it Russian formula

non-Abelian anomalies counterparts in Topological Yang-Mills theory. We suggest
that the presence of the non-Abelian anomaly obstructs the proper definition of
Donaldson's invariants.

by a world-sheet topological gauge field theory which can be represented as a
twisted $N=2$ superconformal Wess-Zumino model with a $W_{1+\infty} \otimes

singularity is associated with Wilson loop integrals around gauge defects. The
breaking of $W_{1+\infty}$ $\otimes $ $W_{1+\infty}$ $\rightarrow $
$W_{1+\infty}$ is associated with expectation values for open Wilson lines that
make the metric non-singular away from the singularity. This symmetry breaking
is accompanied by massless discrete `tachyon' states that appear as leg poles
in $S$-matrix elements. The triviality of the $S$-matrix in the high-energy
limit of the $c=1$ string model, after renormalisation by the leg pole factors,
is due to the restoration of double $W$-symmetry at the singularity.
