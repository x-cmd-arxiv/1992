arbitrary spacetimes to prove the correctness of the description of
gravitational lensing by gravitational waves, given in the literature using the
scalar and vector formalisms. We obtain an expression for the time delay due to
such nonstationary lenses; the advantage over previous papers is that Perlick's
formulation of the Fermat principle is very rigorous and more suitable for
practical calculations in some cases. It is also shown that ordinary moving
gravitational lenses must be considered as a stationary case.

  Skewed Magnetic Field","12 pages","Astrophys.J. 393 (1992) L71-L74","10.1086/186454",,"astro-ph",,"  The effect of the magnetic skew on the Parker instability is investigated by
means of the linear stability analysis for a gravitationally stratified gas
layer permeated by a horizontal magnetic field. When the magnetic field is
skewed (i.e., the field line direction is a function of the height), the
wavelength of the most unstable mode is $ \lambda \; \sim \; 10 H $ where $ H $
is the pressure scale height. The growth rate of the short wavelength modes is
greatly reduced when the gradient in the magnetic field direction exceeds 0.5
radian per scale height. Our results indicate that the Parker instability in a
skewed magnetic field preferentially forms large scale structures like giant
molecular clouds.

Workshop ``Non perturbative aspects of chiral gauge theories'', Accademia

minimal standard model is bounded by triviality and vacuum stability in the
range 50--100 $GeV$ to 700--900 $GeV$. Recent results will be presented in
brief and directions for future work will be proposed.

to construct all Landau-Ginzburg (LG) potentials for N=2 superconformal field
theories with c=9 and calculate the corresponding Hodge numbers. Surprisingly,
the resulting spectra are less symmetric than the existing incomplete results.
It turns out that models belonging to the large class for which an explicit
construction of a mirror model as an orbifold is known show remarkable mirror
symmetry. On the other hand, half of the remaining 15\% of all models have no
mirror partners. This lack of mirror symmetry may point beyond the class of
LG-orbifolds.
