of the flow that the finite length has little effect on the properties of the
fluid in the central region. The simulated system is represented by an
efficient data structure, whose internal elements are created and manipulated
dynamically in a layered fashion. Consequently the code is highly efficient and
manifests completely linear performance in simulations of large systems. We
obtain the steady-state velocity, temperature, and density distributions in the
system. The velocity distribution across the channel is very nearly a quadratic
function of the distance from the center of the channel and reveals velocity
slip at the boundaries; the temperature distribution is only approximately a
quartic function of this distance from the center to the channel. The density
distribution across the channel is non-uniform. We attribute this
non-uniformity to the relatively high Mach number, approximately 0.5, in the
fluid flow. An equation for the density distribution based on simple
compressibility arguments is proposed; its predictions agree well with the
simulation results. Validity of the concept of local dynamic temperature and
the variation of the temperature along the channel are discussed.

even in the absence of a grand unification symmetry. In particular, if there is
an additional gauged $U(1)$ symmetry at some large scale which can be made
anomaly-free only by a Green-Schwarz (GS) mechanism, this typically results in
a prediction for the weak angle. In the case of the standard model one can see
that the standard Peccei-Quinn symmetry may be gauged and the anomalies
cancelled through a GS mechanism. Remarkably enough, cancelation of anomalies
works only for the `canonical' value $sin^2\theta _W=3/8$. In the case of the
supersymmetric standard model one can also find $U(1)$ currents which may be
made anomaly-free through a GS but the canonical value is only obtained in the
absence of any Higgs multiplet. If the analysis is extended to include $U(1)$
R-symmetries, there is a unique class of $U(1)$s which give rise to the
canonical value. The R-symmetry is only anomaly-free for $sin^2\theta
_W=(4N_g-3)/(10N_g-3N_D-3)$, where $N_g,N_D$ are the number of generations and
Higgs pairs. The natural context in which the above scenario may naturally
arise is string theory. I also emphasize other interesting possibilities
offered by the GS mechanism to model-building.

P-manifolds and SP-manifolds (supermanifolds provided with an odd symplectic
structure and, in the case of SP-manifolds, with a volume element). The
Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure leads to consideration of integrals of the
superharmonic functions over Lagrangian submanifolds. The choice of Lagrangian
submanifold can be interpreted as a choice of gauge condition; Batalin and
Vilkovisky proved that in some sense their procedure is gauge independent. We
prove much more general theorem of the same kind. This theorem leads to a
conjecture that one can modify the quantization procedure in such a way as to
avoid the use of the notion of Lagrangian submanifold. In the next paper we
will show that this is really so at least in the semiclassical approximation.
Namely the physical quantities can be expressed as integrals over some set of
critical points of solution S to the master equation with the integrand
expressed in terms of Reidemeister torsion. This leads to a simplification of
quantization procedure and to the possibility to get rigorous results also in
the infinite-dimensional case. The present paper contains also a compete
classification of P-manifolds and SP-manifolds. The classification is
interesting by itself, but in this paper it plays also a role of an important
tool in the proof of other results.
