temperature phase is investigated by means of the Monte Carlo method. Together
with other physically relevant quantities it is obtained from a calculation of
time-slice correlation functions in a cylindrical geometry. The results at
three different values of the temperature are compared with the predictions
from a semiclassical approximation in the framework of renormalized $\phi^4$
theory in three dimensions, and are in good agreement with them.

$t\to H^+b$ and to $t\to W^+b$ are the same in the heavy top limit.
Asymptotically, they are given by $-{4\alpha_s\over 3\pi}[{\pi^2\over
3}-{5\over 4}]$, resulting in a reduction in the decay rate by about $9\%$,
rather than $6\%$ reported previously in the literature. This is verified
explicitly by an analytic calculation. The application of the equivalence
theorem to this process is also discussed.

three jets, or vice versa. The method is shown to discriminate dramatically
between Monte Carlo generated events with and without simulated top quarks of
mass around 120 GeV and above. The simulations were performed with CDF detector
characteristics incorporated, showing that the method is applicable to existing

phase space of general relativity in the Hamiltonian formulation. Recent work
in finite-dimensional models claims that topological obstructions generically
make the global definition of time impossible. It is shown here that a time
coordinate can be globally defined on a constrained phase space by patching
together local time coordinates, just as coordinates are defined on
topologically non-trivial manifolds.

$\bZ_4$ parafermions and free bosons. The bosonization of the $\bZ_4$
parafermion theory and the generalized commutation relations satisfied by the
modes of various parafermion fields are reviewed. In this preliminary analysis,
we describe a Fock space which is simply a tensor product of $\bZ_4$
parafermion and free boson Fock spaces. It is larger than the Lorentz-covariant
Fock space indicated by the fractional superstring partition function. We
derive the form of the fractional superconformal algebra that may be used as
the constraint algebra for the physical states of the FSS. Issues concerning
the associativity, modings and braiding properties of the fractional
superconformal algebra are also discussed. The use of the constraint algebra to
obtain physical state conditions on the spectrum is illustrated by an
application to the massless fermions and bosons of the $K=4$ fractional
superstring. However, we fail to generalize these considerations to the massive
states. This means that the appropriate constraint algebra on the fractional
superstring Fock space remains to be found. Some possible ways of doing this
are discussed.
