method originally proposed by Perelomov. Algebraic and geometrical properties
of the systems of states thus obtained are examined, with particular attention
to the possibility of defining a K\""ahler structure over the states

coadjoint orbits of the dynamical supergroup. The theory is then applied to
some compact forms of contragradient Lie superalgebras.

dynamics. Diffusion-dominated processes slow down as the anisotropy increases.
For large times or large anisotropy, one can invoke the appropriate continuum
limits. In these limits the effects of the anisotropy on variation of particle
density can be absorbed in time rescaling. However, in other regimes, when the
discreteness of the time steps is nonnegligible, the anisotropy effects are
nontrivial, although they are always quite small numerically.

$L_\tau$-violation is motivated by the relative lack of constraints on such

$L_\mu$-violation. The $LSP$, now unstable, and not necessarily neutral, decays
via $L_\tau$-violating modes. Only signals from the production and decays of
$LSP$ pairs are considered, thereby avoiding any dependence on the sparticle
mass spectrum. Rather spectacular signals are predicted: spherical events with
$m$ leptons (usually containing at least one $\tau$) and $n$ jets $(m,n \leq
4)$, the most characteristic of which are like-sign $\tau\tau$ events. These
signals are enumerated for each $LSP$ candidate and quantitative estimates are
provided for the favoured case when the $LSP$ is a neutralino. Other new
physics signals, which can mimic these signatures, are also briefly discussed.

that the quantum BPS magnetic monopole differential cross-section is
well-approximated by the classical BPS magnetic monopole differential
cross-section. In particular, the expected quantum interference effects for
bosons at scattering angle $\theta=\pi/2$ (CoM frame) are contradicted
numerically. We argue that this is due to the topology of the classical
configuration space for these solitons. We also study the scattering and
bounded classical motions of BPS dyons and their global structure in phase
space by constructing `escape plots'. The escape plots contain a surprising
amount of structure, and suggest that the classical dynamics of two BPS $SU(2)$
magnetic monopoles is chaotic and that there are closed and bounded two dyon
motions with isolated energies.
