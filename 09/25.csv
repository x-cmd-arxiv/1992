condensed matter physics, is analyzed and extended here: One is given a planar
graph (or lattice) with prescribed vertices, edges and a weight $\vert
t_{xy}\vert$ on each edge $(x,y)$. The flux phase problem (which we partially
solve) is to find the real phase function on the edges, $\theta(x,y)$, so that
the matrix $T:=\{\vert t_{xy}\vert {\rm exp}[i\theta(x,y)]\}$ minimizes the sum
of the negative eigenvalues of $-T$. One extension of this problem which is
also partially solved is the analogous question for the Falicov-Kimball model.
There one replaces the matrix $-T$ by $-T+V$, where $V$ is a diagonal matrix
representing a potential. Another extension of this problem, which we solve
completely for planar, bipartite graphs, is to maximize $\vert {\rm det}\ T
\vert$. Our analysis of this determinant problem is closely connected with
Kasteleyn's 1961 theorem (for arbitrary planar graphs) and, indeed, yields an
alternate, and we believe more transparent proof of it. {}.

considering the process by which data are analyzed in a noisy detector. By
constructing the probability that the detector output is consistent with the
presence of a signal, I show how to (1) quantify the uncertainty that the
output contains a signal and is not simply noise, and (2) construct the
probability distribution that the signal parameterization has a certain value.
  From the distribution and its mode I determine volumes $V(P)$ in parameter
space such that actual signal parameters are in $V(P)$ with probability $P$. If
we are {\em designing} a detector, or determining the suitability of an
existing detector for observing a new source, then we don't have detector
output to analyze but are interested in the ``most likely'' response of the
detector to a signal. I exploit the techniques just described to determine the
``most likely'' volumes $V(P)$ for detector output corresponding to the source.
Finally, as an example, I apply these techniques to anticipate the sensitivity
of the LIGO and LAGOS detectors to the gravitational radiation from a perturbed
Kerr black hole.

this model. One kind has a rotational anomaly in the form of arbitrary phases
that develop in $2\pi$ rotations; the other kind rotates ``normally''---i.e.,
charged states only change sign in $2\pi$ rotations. The rotational anomaly has
nothing to do with the implementation of Gauss's law. It is possible to
inadvertently produce these anomalous states in the process of implementing
Gauss's law, but it is also possible to implement Gauss's law without producing
rotational anomalies. Moreover, states with or without rotational anomalies
obey ordinary Fermi statistics.

energy momentum tensor for a conformally coupled scalar field is calculated on
this generalised Misner space. It is found to diverge very weakly on the
Chronology horizon, but more strongly on the polarised hypersurfaces. The
divergence on the polarised hypersurfaces is strong enough that when the proper
geodesic interval around any polarised hypersurface is of order the Planck
length squared, the perturbation to the metric caused by the backreaction will
be of order one. Thus we expect the structure of the space will be radically
