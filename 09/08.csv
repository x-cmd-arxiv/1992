  correlation length and Raman scattering experiments","14 pages, 1 figure available on request from bob@rjg.phy.queensu.ca",,,,"cond-mat",,"  A model of $CuO_2$ planes weakly doped with partially delocalised holes is
considered. The effect of such a hole on the background AFM spin texture can be
represented by a purely magnetic Hamiltonian $H = - \sum_{(ijk)} (\vec S_i
\cdot \vec S_j \times \vec S_k)^2$, where the summation is over the four
triangles of a single plaquette. We show that this model of randomly
distributed chiral spin defects leads to an in--plane spin correlation length
approximately described by $\xi^{-1} (x,T) = \xi^{-1} (0,T) + \xi^{-1} (x,0)$,
consistent with neutron scattering experiments on $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$. Further,
this model leads to favourable comparisons with $B_{1g}$ Raman scattering
results for the same cuprate system.

localized moments, in the hexagonal uranium heavy-fermion compounds. The model
considers a non-Kramers quadrupolar doublet ground state magnetically coupled
with a singlet excited-state, favoring in-plane van-Vleck magnetism, as has
been conjectured for UPt$_3$. The Hamiltonian which defines the model is
Heisenberg like in both, magnetic and quadrupolar moments. Among our main
results are: (i) for zero intersite quadrupolar coupling, the magnetic order is
achieved by a first order transition above a critical intersite magnetic
coupling value which becomes second order at higher coupling strengths. (ii)
for finite intersite quadrupolar coupling, at temperatures below a second order
quadrupolar ordering transition, the minimal magnetic coupling value is
increased but (a) the magnetic ordering temperature is enhanced above this
value, and (b) the ordering of first and second order transitions in the phase
diagram is reversed.

parameter space of the minimal $SU(5)$ supergravity model, including the
constraints of a long enough proton lifetime ($\tau_p>1\times10^{32}\y$) and a
small enough neutralino cosmological relic density ($\Omega_\chi h^2_0\le1$).
We find that the combined effect of these two constraints is quite severe,
although still leaving a small region of parameter space with $m_{\tilde
g,\tilde q}<1\TeV$. The allowed values of the proton lifetime extend up to
$\tau_p\approx1\times10^{33}\y$ and should be fully explored by the
SuperKamiokande experiment. The proton lifetime cut also entails the following
mass correlations and bounds: $m_h\lsim100\GeV$,
$m_\chi\approx{1\over2}m_{\chi^0_2}\approx0.15\gluino$, $m_{\chi^0_2}\approx
m_{\chi^+_1}$, and $m_\chi<85\,(115)\GeV$,
$m_{\chi^0_2,\chi^+_1}<165\,(225)\GeV$ for $\alpha_3=0.113\,(0.120)$. Finally,
the {\it combined} proton decay and cosmology constraints predict that if
$m_h\gsim75\,(80)\GeV$ then $m_{\chi^+_1}\lsim90\,(110)\GeV$ for
$\alpha_3=0.113\,(0.120)$. Thus, if this model is correct, at least one of
these particles will likely be observed at LEPII.

monogenic left-distributive algebra~$A_\infty$. Results of Laver and Steel
assuming a strong large cardinal axiom imply that $A_\infty$ is free; it is
open whether the freeness of $A_\infty$ can be proved without the large
cardinal assumption, or even in Peano arithmetic. The main result of this paper
is the equivalence of this problem with the existence of a certain algebra of
increasing functions on natural numbers, called an {\it embedding algebra}.
Using this and results of the first author, we conclude that the freeness of
$A_\infty$ is unprovable in primitive recursive arithmetic.
