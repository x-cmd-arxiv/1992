  on a square lattice","21 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.47.8769",,"cond-mat",,"  The existance of a spin disordered ground state for the frustrated Quantum
Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on a square lattice is reconsidered. It is argued
that there is a unique action which is continuous through the whole phase
diagram, except at the Lifshitz point, so that the Neel and helicoidal states
can not coexist and there has to be an intermediate spin liquid state. To show
it, a detailed study combining Spin-Wave theory, Schwinger Bosons Mean Field
Theory and a scaling analysis of the appropriate hydrodynamic action is
performed. When done carefully, all these theories agree and strongly support
the existance of the spin liquThe manuscript has eight figures, which are

"gr-qc/9209004",,"Edward Malec and Niall \'O Murchadha","A Quasilocal Test of the Finiteness of the Universe","4pages, plaintex",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  The Cosmological Principle states that the universe is both homogeneous and
isotropic. This, alone, is not enough to specify the global geometry of the
spacetime. If we were able to measure both the Hubble constant and the energy
density we could determine whether the universe is open or closed.
Unfortunately, while some agreement exists on the value of the Hubble constant,
the question of the energy density seems quite intractable. This Letter
describes a possible way of avoiding this difficulty and shows that if one
could measure the rate at which light-rays emerging from a surface expand, one
might well be able to deduce whether the universe is closed.

fixed reference length seen on the sky to reach a minimum and then increase
with redshift, depends sensitively on the value of the cosmological constant,
$\Lambda$, in a flat universe. The redshift of an observed minimum and the
asymptotic slope can in principle provide strong constraints on $\Lambda$. The
sensitivity to a non-zero cosmological constant in a flat universe is compared
to the sensitivity to $q_0$ in an open universe without a cosmological
constant, and to inherent ambiguities due to uncertainties in distance measures
and the possible effects of evolution. If evolutionary uncertainties can be
overcome, the reported observations of the angular diameter of compact radio
jets as a function of redshift, which appear to exhibit such a minimum, could
provide the strongest available limit on the cosmological constant in a flat
universe, and on $\Omega$ in an open universe.

classical theory of electrodynamics both have components which are considered
to be ordinary smooth functions on space-time. We reformulate electrodynamics
by adding an additional structure to the algebra of these functions in the form
of the algebra $M_n$ of $n \times n$ complex matrices. This involves a
generalization of the notions of geometry to include the geometry of matrices.
Some rather general constraints on the reformulation are imposed which can be
motivated by considering matrix geometry in the limit of very large $n$. A few
of the properties of the resulting models are given for the values $n=2,3$. One
of the more interesting is the existence of several distinct stable phases or
vacua. The fermions can be quark-like in one and lepton-like in another.

a sufficiently large representation of the gauge group is completely equivalent
to the cohomology of the finite dimensional gauge group. For pure YM theory or
YM theory coupled to chiral fermions in small representations there exists an
infinite number of inequivalent cohomology classes. This is discussed in some
detail for the example of $SU(2)$.
