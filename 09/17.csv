(I-V) characteristics of polycrystalline semiconductors, such as ZnO-based
varistors, is made from the electrical properties of individual grain
boundaries under dc bias. The role played by the fluctuations of double
Schottky barrier heights at grain interfaces on driving electrical breakdown
phenomena of macroscopic samples is pointed out in terms of a binary mixture
model. An alternative trial form for the double Schottky barrier height is
introduced to reproduce the breakdown voltage as well as the high non-linear
coefficient alpha, where I propto V^{alpha}. -------------

deposited on Ru(001), a simple simulation model based on irreversible
diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is discussed. Highly irregular
two-dimensional dentritic islands of Au particles that gradually grow on a
larger host lattice of Ru particles and have fractal dimension d_{f}~ 1.70
each, are generated via a multiple had-hoc version of the DLA algorithm for
single aggregates. Annealing effects on the islands morphology are reproduced
assuming different sticking probabilities at nearest-neighbour lattice sites of
Au films on Ru(001). Using simulation data, islands growth are described in
analogy to diffusion-limited, precipitate growth with soft impingement of
precipities. This leads to analyse thin film island growth kinetics in such
fractal systems and to predict a main peak in scattering intensity patterns due
to interisland interference. ----------------

experimental bound on the neutron's electric dipole moment by one order of

the the lightest neutralino to be lighter than 44 GeV. In extensions of this
model with gauge singlet superfields all of these bounds are eliminated.

critical bubbles and the effects of thermal fluctuations (which could be
relevant for vortex production) are represented by randomly nucleating
subcritical bubbles. Our results show that the presence of subcritical bubbles
suppresses vortices with clear and prominent profiles, though net number of
vortices is consistent with theoretical estimates. We also determine the
typical speed of vortices arising due to randomness associated with the phase
transition to be about 0.5.

explaining why it can be identified as the partition function of 3-dimensional

from the duality data of a certain class of rational conformal field theories,
and that, in particular, the original Turaev-Viro's initial data is associated
with the $A_{k+1}$ modular invariant WZW model. As a corollary we then show
that the partition function $Z(M)$ is bounded from above by $Z((S^2\times

the smallest genus of handlebodies with which $M$ can be presented by Hegaard
splitting. $Z(M)$ is generically very large near $\Lambda\sim +0$if $M$ is
neither $S^3$ nor a lens space, and many-wormholeconfigurations dominate near
$\Lambda\sim +0$ in the sense that $Z(M)$ generically tends to diverge faster
