probed by atom beam scattering (ABS). At Pb or Bi coverages of 0.05 (fraction
of Cu layer), and while a (1$\times$1) LEED pattern is still observed, the ABS
diffraction pattern from \underbar{uncovered} Cu(001) areas has changed
considerably from that of clean Cu(001). We show that these uncovered areas
have become up to ten times more corrugated than the clean Cu(001). We
performed several carefully designed experiments to test whether our data could
be interpreted as a result of scattering from adsorbate islands or from a
lattice of randomly occupied sites. Instead, we ascribe the nature of this
metal adatom induced corrugation to the redistribution of the Cu(001) surface
charge density due to the adsorption of Pb or Bi atoms. No effect is seen
following adsorption of weakly chemisorbed adatoms, such as Hg. A model
consistent with all our observations is presented.

Z_2-related local minima whose energy splitting is provided by the instanton

the $\theta$-term in QCD has a profound effect: it breaks the CP symmetry. The
CP-violating amplitude is shown to be determined by the vacuum tunneling
process, where the semiclassical method makes most sense. We discuss a
long-standing dispute on whether the instanton dynamics satisfies or not the
anomalous Ward identity (AWI). The strong CP violation measure, when complying
with the vacuum alignment, is proportional to the topological susceptibility.
We obtain an effective CP-violating lagrangian different from that provided by
Baluni. To solve the IR divergence problem of the instanton computation, We
present a ``classically gauged'' Georgi-Manohar model and derive an effective
potential which uniquely determines an explicit $U(1)_A$ symmetry breaking
sector. The CP violation effects are analyzed in this model. It is shown that
the strong CP problem and the $U(1)$ problem are closely related. Some possible
