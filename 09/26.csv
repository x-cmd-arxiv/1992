mass through a Yukawa coupling to some scalar field. Bags have played an
important role in models of baryons, nuclei, and more recently, in the idea
that a Higgs condensate may form around a very heavy top quark. It has been
claimed that deep bags, which correspond to tightly-bound states of fermions,
will form when the Yukawa coupling is strong. Quantum corrections, however, are
significant in this regime. We examine the effects of these quantum corrections
on the formation of nontopological solitons in an exactly solvable large-$N$
model. We find that quantum bags differ dramatically from those of the
classical theory. In particular, for large Yukawa coupling, the bags remain
shallow and the fermions weakly bound.

interesting non-perturbative static spherically symmetric solutions which are
studied by mixed analitical and numerical methods. In the abelian sector of the
theory there are finite-energy magnetic and electric monopole solutions which
saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound. In the nonabelian sector there exist a
countable family of globally regular solutions which are purely magnetic but
have zero Yang-Mills magnetic charge. Their discrete spectrum of energies is
bounded from above by the energy of the abelian magnetic monopole with unit
magnetic charge. The stability analysis demonstrates that the solutions are
saddle points of the energy functional with increasing number of unstable
modes. The existence and instability of these solutions are ""explained"" by the
Morse-theory argument recently proposed by Sudarsky and Wald.

Then Pisier has shown that $E$-spectral polynomials with values in $X$ behave
like Rademacher sums with respect to $L_p-$norms. We consider the situation
when $X$ is a quasi-Banach space. For general quasi-Banach spaces we show that
a similar result holds if and only if $E$ is a set of interpolation
($I_0$-set). However for certain special classes of quasi-Banach spaces we are
able to prove such a result for larger sets. Thus if $X$ is restricted to be
``natural'' then the result holds for all Sidon sets. We also consider spaces
with plurisubharmonic norms and introduce the class of analytic Sidon sets.

spaces on $[0,1]$ or $[0,\infty)$ form a Calder\'on couple. A very general
criterion is developed to determine whether such a pair is a Calder\'on couple,
with numerous applications. We give, for example, a complete classification of
those spaces $X$ which form a Calder\'on couple with $L_{\infty}.$ We
specialize our results to Orlicz spaces and are able to give necessary and
sufficient conditions on an Orlicz function $F$ so that the pair
$(L_F,L_{\infty})$ forms a Calder\'on pair.
