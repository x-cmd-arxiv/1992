  Randomization/Boundary Condition Averaging'","6 pages, 3 postscript figures, appended",,,,"cond-mat",,"  When electron-electron correlations are important, it is often necessary to
use exact numerical methods, such as Lanczos diagonalization, to study the full
many-body Hamiltonian. Unfortunately, such exact diagonalization methods are
restricted to small system sizes. We show that if the Hubbard $U$ term is
replaced by a ``periodic Hubbard"" term, the full many body Hamiltonian may be
numerically exactly solved, even for very large systems (even $>$100 sites),
though only for low fillings. However, for half-filled systems and large $U$
this approach is not only no longer exact, it no longer improves extrapolation
to larger systems. We discuss how generalized ``randomized variable averaging''
(RVA) or ``phase randomization'' schemes can be reliably employed to improve
extrapolation to large system sizes in this regime. This general approach can
be combined with any many-body method and is thus of broad interest and
applicability.

couplings in 1D and 2D multi-band (Peierls-Hubbard) models. After briefly
discussing various analytic limits, we focus on (Hartree-Fock and exact)
numerical studies in the intermediate regime for both couplings, where unusual
spin-Peierls as well as long-period, frustrated ground states are found. Doping
into such phases or near the phase boundaries can lead to further interesting
phenomena such as separation of spin and charge, a dopant-induced phase
transition of the global (parent) phase, or real-space (``bipolaronic'')
pairing. We discuss possible experimentally observable consequences of this
rich phase diagram for halogen-bridged, transition metal, linear chain
complexes (MX chains) in 1D and the oxide superconductors in 2D.

mixed-halide $MX$ complexes ($M$=Pt; $X$=Cl,Br) clearly indicate charge
separation: electron polarons preferentially locate on PtBr segments while hole
polarons are trapped within PtCl segments. This polaron selectivity,
potentially very useful for device applications, is demonstrated theoretically
using a discrete, 3/4-filled, two-band, tight-binding, extended Peierls-Hubbard
model. Strong hybridization of the PtCl and PtBr electronic bands is the
driving force for separation.
