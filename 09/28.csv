Blume-Emery-Griffiths models is investigated in the pair approximation of the
Cluster Variation Method. Equations for bulk and surface order parameters and
n.n. correlation functions are given, from which analytical expressions for the
second order bulk and surface critical temperatures are derived. The phase
diagrams of the Blume-Capel model are classified, and the existence of a
surface first order transition is discussed. This transition is shown to be,
under certain conditions, slightly reentrant, and the behavior of the surface
order parameters and correlation functions is given for such a case. The
extension of our results to the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model is briefly
discussed.

reconstruction. Hydrogen adsorption on a W(100) surface causes a switching
transition in the symmetry of the displacements of the W atoms within the
ordered c(2x2) phase. This transition is modeled by an effective Hamiltonian,
where the hydrogen degrees of freedom are integrated out. Based on extensive
Monte Carlo renormalisation group calculations we show that the switching
transition is of second order at high temperatures and of first order at low
temperatures. This behavior is qualitatively explained in terms of an XY model
where there is an interplay between four and eight fold anisotropy fields. We
also compare the calculated phase diagrams with a simple mean field theory.

the correlation length defined by the second moment of the correlation
function, the topological susceptibility and the string tension. On the other
hand, quantities involving the mass gap are still far from the large-$N$
results showing a very slow approach to the asymptotic regime. To overcome the
problems coming from the severe form of critical slowing down observed at large
N in the measurement of the topological susceptibility by using standard local
algorithms, we performed our simulations implementing the Simulated Tempering

charged Higgs. The charged Higgs contribution at the two loop level can be as
large as the experimental upper bound. In non (pseudo) manifest Left-Right
symmteric models, the neutral Higgs exchange contribution can reach the
experimental upper bound. The Higgs exchange contributions can be more
important than the ones from W-boson exchange due to $W_L - W_R$ mixing.

We find that the nonvanishing Majoron mass generated by these effects can

mass density constraints can then be satisfied only if $V_{BL} < 10$ TeV, where
$V_{BL}$ is the scale of $B-L$ symmetry breaking.
