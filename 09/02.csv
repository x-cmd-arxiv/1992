dimensions. To investigate Euclidean quantum gravity effects in a fundamental
length scenario, we simulate 4$d$ SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a dynamically
coupled Regge skeleton. The fluctuations of the skeleton are governed by the
standard Regge-Einstein action. From a small $2\cdot 4^3$ lattice we report
exploratory numerical results, limited to a region of strong gravity where the
Planck mass and hadronic masses take similar orders of magnitude. We find a
range of the Planck mass where stable bulk expectation values are obtained
which vary smoothly with the gauge coupling, and a remnant of the QCD
deconfining phase transition is located. Note: The full ps file of this

depending on the value of $m/r$, where $m$ is the fermion mass and $r$ is the

discontinuously at $d+1$ different values for $m$, unlike in the continuum.
This behavior is exactly what is required by the peculiar spectrum found for a
recently proposed model of chiral lattice fermions as zeromodes bound to a

the strange quark is an important component of the nucleon. In addition, the

(once appropriate cuts are made), and is found to be quite sensitive to the
choice of extended electroweak model, while being simultaneously insensitive to
structure function uncertainties and QCD corrections. Rates at both the SSC and

examined. It is demonstrated by explicit calculation that, in the pure
Chern-Simons theory, the beta-function for the coefficient of the Chern-Simons
term vanishes to three loop order. Both dimensional regularization and
regularization by introducing a conventional Yang-Mills component in the action
are used. It is shown that dimensional regularization is not gauge invariant at
two loops. A variant of this procedure, similar to regularization by
dimensional reduction used in supersymmetric field theories is shown to obey
the Slavnov-Taylor identity to two loops and gives no renormalization of the
Chern-Simons term. Regularization with Yang-Mills term yields a finite
integer-valued renormalization of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term at
one loop, and we conjecture no renormalization at higher order. We also examine
the renormalization of Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter. We show that in
the non-abelian case the Chern-Simons gauge field as well as the matter fields
require infinite renormalization at two loops and therefore obtain nontrivial
anomalous dimensions. We show that the beta function for the gauge coupling
constant is zero to two-loop order, consistent with the topological
quantization condition for this constant.
