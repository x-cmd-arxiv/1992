between perturbative QCD and non-perturbative fits. We restrict the
perturbative QCD resummation to the large transverse momentum region, and use a
simple Regge-pole parametrization in the infrared region. This picture allows
us to account for existing data, and to estimate the size of the perturbative
contribution to future diffractive measurements. At LHC and SSC energies, we
find that a cut-off BFKL equation can lead to a measurable perturbative
component in traditionally soft processes. In particular, we show that the
total pp cross section could become as large as 228 mb (160 mb) and the rho
parameter as large as 0.23 (0.24) at the SSC (LHC).

0.106 (0.116)$ for $M_{SUSY}^{}=1$ TeV at one-loop (two-loop) order. Including
$b$ and $\tau $ Yukawa couplings in the evolution, we find an upper limit
$m_t\ltap 200$ GeV from Yukawa unification. For given $m_t\ltap 175$ GeV, there
are two solutions for $\beta$, one with $\tan \beta > m_t/m_b$, and one with
$\sin \beta \simeq 0.78(m_t/150\;{\rm GeV})$. Taking a popular ansatz for the
mass matrices at the unified scale, we obtain a lower limit on the top quark
mass of $m_t\gtap 150 (115)$ GeV for $\alpha _3(M_Z)=0.11 (0.12)$ and an upper
limit on the supersymmetry parameter $\tan \beta \ltap 50$ if $\alpha
_3(M_Z)=0.11$. The evolution of the quark mixing matrix elements is also
evaluated.

focused on the {\it symmetric} case where the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
sectors, and hence the characters $\c_L$ and $\c_R$, are associated with the
same Kac-Moody algebras $\g_L=\g_R$ and levels $k_L=k_R$. In this paper we
consider the more general possibility where $(\g_L,k_L)$ may not equal
$(\g_R,k_R)$. We discuss which choices of algebras and levels may correspond to
well-defined conformal field theories, we find the `smallest' such {\it
heterotic} (\ie asymmetric) partition functions, and we give a method,
generalizing the Roberts-Terao-Warner lattice method, for explicitly
constructing many other modular invariants. We conclude the paper by proving
that this new lattice method will succeed in generating all the heterotic
partition functions, for all choices of algebras and levels.

invariant partition functions $\sum N_{LR}\,\c_L\,\C_R$ lies in understanding
the commutant of the modular matrices $S$ and $T$. We begin this paper
extending the work of Bauer and Itzykson on the commutant from the $SU(N)$ case
they consider to the case where the underlying algebra is any semi-simple Lie
algebra (and the levels are arbitrary). We then use this analysis to show that
the partition functions associated with even self-dual lattices span the
commutant. This proves that the lattice method due to Roberts and Terao, and
Warner, will succeed in generating all partition functions. We then make some
general remarks concerning certain properties of the coefficient matrices
$N_{LR}$, and use those to explicitly find all level 1 partition functions
corresponding to the algebras $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$, and the 5 exceptionals.
Previously, only those associated to $A_n$ seemed to be generally known.
