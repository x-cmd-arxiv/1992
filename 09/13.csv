from power-law (or extended) inflation, which are tilted with respect to the
Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum, may provide an explanation for the excess large
scale clustering seen in galaxy surveys such as the APM survey. In the light of
the new results from COBE, we examine in detail here cold dark matter
cosmogonies based on inflationary models predicting power-law spectra. Along
with power-law and extended inflation, this class includes natural inflation.
The latter is of interest because, unlike the first two, it produces a
power-law spectrum without significant gravitational wave production. We
examine a range of phenomena, including large angle microwave background
fluctuations, clustering in the galaxy distribution, bulk peculiar velocity
flows, the formation of high redshift quasars and the epoch of structure
formation. Of the three models, only natural inflation seems capable of
explaining the large scale clustering of optical galaxies. Such a model, though
at best marginal even at present, has some advantages over standard CDM and on
most grounds appears to perform at least as well. Power-law inflation's primary
interest may ultimately only be in permitting a larger bias parameter than
standard CDM; it appears unable to explain excess clustering. Most models of
extended inflation are ruled out at a high confidence level.

Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model applied to a single C_60 molecule. To calculate the
luminescence we use a collective coordinate method where our collective
coordinate resembles the displacement of the carbon atoms of the Hg(8) phonon
mode and extrapolates between the ground state ""dimerisation"" and the exciton
polaron. There is good agreement for the existing luminescence peak spacing and
fair agreement for the relative intensity. We predict the existence of further
peaks not yet resolved in experiment. PACS Numbers : 78.65.Hc, 74.70.Kn,

the NLS hierarchy and of its reduction, the KdV hierarchy, is an exact result
of the lattice characterizing the matrix model. Said otherwise, we are not
obliged to take a continuum limit to find these hierarchies. We interpret this
result as an indication of the topological nature of them. We discuss the
topological field theories associated with both and discuss the connection with
topological field theories coupled to topological gravity already studied in
the literature.
