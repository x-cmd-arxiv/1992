formation of unacceptably massive domain walls. We point out that there are a
number of plausible quark-lepton symmetric models which do not produce
cosmologically troublesome domain walls. We also raise what we think are some
interesting questions concerning anomalous discrete symmetries.

vector, and axial-vector bound states, originating from a strong breaking of
the electroweak symmetry, based on the global symmetry $SU(N)_L\otimes
SU(N)_R$. In this approach vector and axial-vector bound states are gauge
bosons associated to a hidden $SU(N)_L\otimes SU(N)_R$ symmetry. After the
gauging of the electroweak symmetry, the corrections to the self-energies of
the standard model gauge bosons are calculated and bounds on the parameter
space of the model arising from precision measurements are studied. The
self-energy corrections arise from spin 1 mixings, pseudogoldstones loops,
pseudogoldstone-spin 1 loops, and tadpole terms. The one-loop terms tend to
decrease both isospin conserving and isospin violating corrections. Careful
calculation for standard $SU(8)$ QCD-scaled technicolor shows that strictly
this model (which has however serious theoretical difficulties on his own) is
still marginally allowed at present experimental precision.

They first present a summary of the paradox of information loss to black holes,
of its proposed resolutions, and of the flaws in the proposed resolutions.
There follows a review of recent attempts to attack this problem, and other
issues in black hole physics, using two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories as
toy models. These toy models contain collapsing black holes and have for the
first time enabled an explicit semiclassical treatment of the backreaction of
the Hawking radiation on the geometry of an evaporating black hole. However, a
complete answer to the information conundrum seems to require physics beyond
the semiclassical approximation. Preliminary attempts to make progress in this
direction, using connections to conformal field theory, are described.

Implementation of this rule remains difficult, however, since the basis states
convenient for calculating tensor product coefficients do not have a
well-defined depth. To avoid this problem, we present a `crystal depth rule',
that gives a lower bound for the minimum level at which a WZNW fusion appears.
The bound seems to be quite accurate for $su(N>3),$ and for $su(3)$ the rule is
proven to be exact. (Talk presented by M.W. at the XIXth International

holes, which have unbroken $N=2$ supersymmetry, behave near the horizon as a

black holes to be greater than or equal to the central charge, corresponds to
positivity of mass for a class of stringy 2-d black holes.
