superconductivity is happening so close to the antiferromagnetic state. The
nuclear magnetic resonance and the recent neutron scattering experiments
clearly indicate that magnetic correlations persist in to the heavily doped
regime. In this paper we will discuss some of the details of the coupling of
the nuclear magnetic spin to the conduction electron spins. Furthermore we will
show that a simple band structure can explain the recent neutron scattering
data in the \LaSrCuO material for the optimal concentration of $x\approx 0.15$
if the lifetime effects are included.

observed in all $CuO_2$ based superconductors with less than optimal doping. We
propose that in $La_{2-x} Sr_x CuO_4$ this is due to antiferromagnetic ordering
which is prevented by the low spatial dimensionality while in $YBa_2 Cu_3
O_{6.6}$ it is due to the interplay between antiferromagnetic fluctuations
within a plane and singlet pairing of electrons between nearest neighbor
planes.

net charge to atoms, if the charges of electrons and positrons do not balance
precisely. We obtain the limit $|Q_e+Q_{\bar e}| < 10^{-18} e$ for the sum of
the charges of electron and positron. This also constitutes a new bound on
certain violations of PCT invariance.

"hep-th/9209018",,"Rolf Schimmrigk","The Construction of Mirror Symmetry","58 pages, Latex file, HD-THEP-92-13",,,,"hep-th",,"  The construction of mirror symmetry in the heterotic string is reviewed in
the context of Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg compactifications. This framework
has the virtue of providing a large subspace of the configuration space of the
heterotic string, probing its structure far beyond the present reaches of
solvable models. The construction proceeds in two stages: First all
singularities/catastrophes which lead to ground states of the heterotic string
are found. It is then shown that not all ground states described in this way
are independent but that certain classes of these LG/CY string vacua can be
related to other, simpler, theories via a process involving fractional
transformations of the order parameters as well as orbifolding. This
construction has far reaching consequences. Firstly it allows for a systematic
identification of mirror pairs that appear abundantly in this class of string
vacua, thereby showing that the emerging mirror symmetry is not accidental.
This is important because models with mirror flipped spectra are a priori
independent theories, described by distinct CY/LG models. It also shows that
mirror symmetry is not restricted to the space of string vacua described by
theories based on Fermat potentials (corresponding to minimal tensor models).
Furthermore it shows the need for a better set of coordinates of the
configuration space or else the structure of this space will remain obscure.
While the space of LG vacua is {\it not} completely mirror symmetric, results
described in the last part suggest that the space of Landau--Ginburg {\it
orbifolds} possesses this symmetry.
