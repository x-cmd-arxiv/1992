framework of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The matrix elements and the
selection rules for both the single photon (emission - absorption) and two
photon (Raman scattering) processes are obtained. The results reveal striking
asymmetries: light absorption by quasiparticle pair creation or single
quasiparticle scattering can occur only if the handedness of the incident
radiation is opposite to that of the vortex core states. We show how these
effects will lead to nonreciprocal circular birefringence, and also predict
structure in the frequency dependence of conductivity and in the differential
cross section of the Raman scattering.

  Theory Approach for the Fractional Quantum Hall System","12p. Latex",,,"AS-ITP-92-44","cond-mat",,"  By applying the Dirac quantization method, we build the constraint that all
electrons are in the lowest Landau level into the Chern-Simons field theory
approach for the fractional quantum Hall system and show that the constraint
can be transmuted from hierarchy to hierarchy. For a finite system, we derive
that the action for each hierarchy can be split into two parts: a surface part
provides the action for the edge excitations while the remaining part is
precisely the bulk action for the next hierarchy. And the action for the edge
could be decoupled from the bulk only at the hierarchy filling.

the lowest Landau level condition and the particle number. In the droplet
approximation it reduces to the algebra of area-preserving diffeomorphisms,
which is responsible for the existence of a universal chiral boson Lagrangian
independent of the electrostatic potential. We argue that the bosonic droplet
approximation is the strong magnetic field limit of the fermionic theory. The

is shown that for the full two-shift, the collection of such invariant sets

implication is an analogous result that holds for diffeomorphisms with
transverse homoclinic points. It is also shown that the union of Denjoy minimal
