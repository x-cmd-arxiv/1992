compact, not necessarily convex values. In this paper, we prove that, if $F$
satisfies the following Lipschitz Selection Property: \begin{itemize}
\item[{(LSP)}] {\sl For every $t,x$, every $y\in \overline{co} F(t,x)$ and
$\varepsilon>0$, there exists a Lipschitz selection $\phi$ of $\overline{co}F$,
defined on a neighborhood of $(t,x)$, with $|\phi(t,x)-y|<\varepsilon$.}
\end{itemize} then there exists a measurable selection $f$ of $ext F$\ such
that, for every $x_0$, the Cauchy problem $$ \dot x(t)=f(t,x(t)),\qquad\qquad
x(0)=x_0 $$ has a unique Caratheodory solution, depending continuously on
$x_0$. We remark that every Lipschitz multifunction with compact values
satisfies (LSP). Another interesting class, for which (LSP) holds, consists of
those continuous multifunctions $F$ whose values are compact and have convex
closure with nonempty interior.

interface free energy of Ising models. The basic idea is to simulate an
ensemble that consists of both configurations with periodic and with
antiperiodic boundary conditions. A cluster algorithm is provided that
efficently updates this joint ensemble. The interface tension is obtained from
the ratio of configurations with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions,
respectively. The method is tested for the 3-dimensional Ising model.

models based on extended gauge groups (rank $>$4) when new charged fermions are
present together with a new neutral gauge boson. We discuss the cases in which
the flavor changing couplings in the new neutral current coupled to the
$Z^\prime$ are theoretically expected to be large, implying that the observed
suppression of neutral flavor changing transitions must be provided by heavy
$Z^\prime$ masses together with small $Z$-$Z^\prime$ mixing angles.
Concentrating on E$_6$ models, we show how the tight experimental limit on $\mu
\rightarrow eee$ implies serious constraints on the $Z^\prime$ mass and mixing
angle. We conclude that if the value of the flavor changing parameters is
assumed to lie in a theoretically natural range, in most cases the presence of
a $Z^\prime$ much lighter than 1 TeV is unlikely.

Connes is used to construct
models in particle physics. The physical space-time is taken to be a product of
a continuous four-manifold by a discrete set of points. The treatment of Connes
is modified in such a way that the basic algebra is defined over the space of
matrices, and the breaking mechanism is planted in the Dirac operator. This
mechanism is then applied to three examples. In the first example the discrete
space consists of two points, and the two algebras are taken respectively to be
those of $2\times 2$ and $1\times 1$ matrices. With the Dirac operator
containing the vacuum breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)$ to $U(1)$, the model is shown
to correspond to the standard model. In the second example the discrete space
has three points, two of the algebras are identical and consist of $5\times 5$
complex matrices, and the third algebra consists of functions. With an
appropriate Dirac operator this model is almost identical to the minimal
$SU(5)$ model of Georgi and Glashow. The third and final example is the
left-right symmetric model $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}.$

that diam$({\cal M}_n^1)\geq cn$ for some absolute constant $c$. Our purpose is
to study this problem in the $p$-convex setting. In [Pe], T. Peck gave an upper
bound of the diameter of ${\cal M}_n^p$, the class of all $n$-dimensional
$p$-normed spaces, namely, diam$({\cal M}_n^p)\leq n^{2/p-1}$. We will show
that such bound is optimum.
