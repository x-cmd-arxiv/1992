general class of classical non-linear sigma models which are known to be
integrable. Using the current algebra structure of these models their canonical
structure is analysed and it is shown that their non ultralocal fundamental
Poisson bracket relation is governed by a field dependent non antisymmetric
r-matrix obeying a dynamical Yang Baxter equation. Contribution presented at

periodic trajectories of a classical Hamiltonian system $(Q, \omega, H)$ from
the case $Q = T^*R^n$ to arbitrary symplectic manifolds. As it turns out, it is
precisely this index which appears as a Maslov phase in the trace formulas by
Gutzwiller and Duistermaat-Guillemin. Contribution presented at the XIX ICGTMP

  Independent Chern-Simons Interaction","32 pages, LATEX, SNUTP 92-79","Phys.Rev. D47 (1993) 673-684","10.1103/PhysRevD.47.673",,"hep-th",,"  Self-dual vortex solutions are studied in detail in the generalized abelian
Higgs model with independent Chern-Simons interaction. For special choices of
couplings, it reduces to a Maxwell-Higgs model with two scalar fields, a
Chern-Simons-Higgs model with two scalar fields, or other new models. We
investigate the properties of the static solutions and perform detailed
numerical analyses. For the Chern-Simons-Higgs model with two scalar fields in
an asymmetric phase, we prove the existence of multisoliton solutions which can
be viewed as hybrids of Chern-Simons vortices and $CP^1$ lumps. We also discuss
solutions in a symmetric phase with the help of the corresponding exact
solutions in its nonrelativistic limit. The model interpolating all three
models---Maxwell-Higgs, Chern-Simons-Higgs, and $CP^1$ models--- is discussed
briefly. Finally we study the possibility of vortex solutions with half-integer
vorticity in the special case of the model. Numerical results are negative.
