model naturally describes local electron pairs, which can move coherently at
arbitrary momentum. By using an $\eta$-pairing mechanism we can construct
eigenstates of the hamiltonian with off-diagonal-long-range-order (ODLRO).
These might help to relate the model to high-$T_c$ superconductivity. On a
one-dimensional lattice, the model is exactly solvable by Bethe Ansatz.

trilinear gauge boson couplings (TGC's) often give bounds which are much too
stringent. The reason has nothing to do with gauge invariance, in contrast to
the recent claims of de Rujula et. al., since the lagrangians used in these
calculations ARE gauge invariant, with the SU(2)L X U(1)Y symmetry nonlinearly
realized. We trace the true cause of the problem to the improper interpretation
of cutoffs in the calculation. The point is that the cutoff dependence of a
loop integral does not necessarily reflect the true dependence on the heavy
physics scale M. We illustrate that, if done carefully, one finds that the true
constraints on anomalous TGC's are much weaker.

Schur polynomials with operator argument and exploring associativity.
Furthermore we find that the (chiral) symmetry algebra of the charges obtained
by using the descent equations can actually be read off from the cohomology
ring structure by simple operation involving the ghost field $b$. We also
determine the enlarged symmetry algebra which contains the charges having ghost
number $-1$ and $1$. Finally the complete symmetry transformation rules are
derived for closed string discrete states by carefully combining the left and
right sectors. It turns out that the new states introduced recently by Witten

one, are described by world-sheet topological Abelian gauge theories with a
Chern-Simons term. Their effective $N=2$ supersymmetry provides an initial
fixed point where the Bogomolny bound is saturated on the world-sheet,
corresponding to an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution in space-time. Away
from the singularity the gauge theory has world-sheet matter fields, bosons and
fermions, associated with the generation of target space-time. Because the
fermions are complex (cf the Quantum Hall Effect) rather than real (cf
high-$T_c$ superconductors) the energetically-preferred vacuum is not parity or
time-reversal invariant, and the associated renormalization group flow explains
the cosmological arrow of time, as well as the decay of real or virtual black
holes, with a monotonic increase in entropy.
