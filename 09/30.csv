bounded region is obtained by employing a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the
action functional. First, a surface stress-energy-momentum tensor is defined by
the functional derivative of the action with respect to the three-metric on
${}^3B$, the history of the system's boundary. Energy density, momentum
density, and spatial stress are defined by projecting the surface stress tensor
normally and tangentially to a family of spacelike two-surfaces that foliate
${}^3B$. The integral of the energy density over such a two-surface $B$ is the
quasilocal energy associated with a spacelike three-surface $\Sigma$ whose
intersection with ${}^3B$ is the boundary $B$. The resulting expression for
quasilocal energy is given in terms of the total mean curvature of the spatial
boundary $B$ as a surface embedded in $\Sigma$. The quasilocal energy is also
the value of the Hamiltonian that generates unit magnitude proper time
translations on ${}^3B$ in the direction orthogonal to $B$. Conserved charges
such as angular momentum are defined using the surface stress tensor and
Killing vector fields on ${}^3B$. For spacetimes that are asymptotically flat
in spacelike directions, the quasilocal energy and angular momentum defined
here agree with the results of Arnowitt-Deser-Misner in the limit that the
boundary tends to spatial infinity. For spherically symmetric spacetimes, it is
shown that the quasilocal energy has the correct Newtonian limit, and includes
a negative contribution due to gravitational binding.

$m_{1/2}$, the universal scalar mass $m_0$ and the coupling $A$. The
composition of the LSP is determined exactly below the W mass, no

is then obtained by an analytic approximation. We find that in these models,

carrying out the dimensional reduction of the massless fields, we obtain the
bosonic sector of this theory. In the Abelian case the action is written with
manifest global $O(6,6+n)$ symmetry. A duality transformation that replaces the
antisymmetric tensor field by an axion brings it to a form in which the axion
and dilaton parametrize an $SL(2,R)/SO(2)$ coset, and the equations of motion
have $SL(2,R)$ symmetry. This symmetry, which combines Peccei--Quinn
translations with Montonen--Olive duality transformations, has been exploited
in several recent papers to construct black hole solutions carrying both
electric and magnetic charge. Our purpose is to explore whether, as various
authors have conjectured, an $SL(2,Z)$ subgroup could be an exact symmetry of
the full quantum string theory. If true, this would be of fundamental
importance, since this group transforms the dilaton nonlinearly and can relate
