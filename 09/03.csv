theory are spontaneously broken by a Higgs mechanism by invoking a phase
transition in the early Universe, at a critical temperature $T_c$ below which
the symmetry is restored. The spontaneous breakdown of the vacuum state
generates an external time and the wave function of the Universe satisfies a
time dependent Schrodinger equation, which reduces to the Wheeler-deWitt
equation in the classical regime for $T < T_c$, allowing a semi-classical WKB
approximation to the wave function. The conservation of energy is spontaneously
violated for $T > T_c$ and matter is created fractions of seconds after the big
bang, generating the matter in the Universe. The time direction of the vacuum
expectation value of the scalar Higgs field generates a time asymmetry, which
defines the cosmological arrow of time and the direction of increasing entropy
as the Lorentz symmetry is restored at low temperatures.

in the broken phase is determined from the finite volume effects of the
partition function Z(M) at fixed total magnetization M. For small |M| the
partition function of a system of size L^d with periodic boundary conditions is
dominated by configurations with two interfaces, such that Z(M) ~ exp(- 2 sigma
L^{d-1}). Capillary wave fluctuations of the interfaces correct this result to
Z(M) ~ exp(- 2 sigma L^{d-1}) with x = -1. The knowledge of the pre-exponential
behavior allows an improved fit of numerical data, and a determination of the
interface stiffness.

of $ZFC$. We give an example of a first order theory $T$ with countable $D(T)$
which cannot have a universal model at $\aleph_1$ without CH; we prove in $ZFC$
a covering theorem from the hypothesis of the existence of a universal model
for some theory; and we prove --- again in ZFC --- that for a large class of
cardinals there is no universal linear order (e.g. in every
$\aleph_1<\l<2^{\aleph_0}$). In fact, what we show is that if there is a
universal linear order at a regular $\l$ and its existence is not a result of a
trivial cardinal arithmetical reason, then $\l$ ``resembles'' $\aleph_1$ --- a
cardinal for which the consistency of having a universal order is known. As for
singular cardinals, we show that for many singular cardinals, if they are not
strong limits then they have no universal linear order. As a result of the non
existence of a universal linear order, we show the non-existence of universal
models for all theories possessing the strict order property (for example,
ordered fields and groups, Boolean algebras, p-adic rings and fields, partial
orders, models of PA and so on).
