put on the euclidean invariance properties of the boson propagator. A measure

regularization dependence of the triviality bound.

wide range of temperatures, covering the whole region from the low temperature
domain through the roughening transition to the bulk critical point. The
interface tension sigma is obtained by integrating the surface energy density
over the inverse temperature beta. We use lattices of size L x L x T, with L up
to 64, and T up to 27. The simulations with antiperiodic boundary conditions in
T-direction are done with the Hasenbusch-Meyer interface cluster algorithm that
turns out to be very efficient. We demonstrate that in the rough phase the
large distance behavior of the interface is well described by a massless
Gaussian dynamics. The surface stiffness coefficient kappa is determined. We
also attempt to determine the correlation length xi and study universal
quantities like xi^2 * sigma and xi^2 * kappa. Results for the interfacial
width on lattices up to 512 x 512 x 27 are also presented.

the study of their predicted values of $ \sigma_{tot}$, B, and

Our results strongly support a picture of the Pomeron in which we have both
moderate blackening and expansion of the p($\bar{p}$) - p amplitude in impact
parameter space as a function of energy in the ISR-SSC domain. In particular,
we obtain an excellent reproduction of the data with a hybrid eikonal model
which combines the hard Lipatov-like QCD Pomeron with the old fashioned soft
Pomeron and Regge terms. Our analysis shows that the additive quark model, at
least in the naive form, is not compatible with the data.

exotic particles with fractional electric charges. Such particles could escape
present observations if they are confined by a gauge group of the ""hidden""
sector into integrally charged states. It is conceivable that the same gauge
group is also responsible for dynamical supersymmetry breaking, via gaugino and
scalar condensation. The communication of the breaking to the observable sector
is now mediated by ordinary gauge interactions, implying that the confining
scale can be in the TeV-region. We study the main phenomenological implications
of this possibility. In particular, we analyze the pattern of supersymmetry
breaking and the mass-spectrum of the sparticles. We also show that this
scenario can be consistent with the unification of all coupling constants at
the string scale.
