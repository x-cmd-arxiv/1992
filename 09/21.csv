phase transition which completes by the nucleation of critical bubbles.
Recently, there has been speculation that the standard picture of the
electroweak phase transition is incorrect. Instead, it has been proposed that
throughout the phase transition appreciable amounts of both broken and unbroken
phases of $SU(2)$ coexist in equilibrium. I argue that this can not be the
case. General principles insure that the universe will remain in a homogenous
state of unbroken $SU(2)$ until the onset of critical bubble production.

the observed particles appear to be quantized. An approach to understanding
electric charge quantization that can be used for gauge theories with explicit
$U(1)$ factors -- such as the standard model and its variants -- is
pedagogically reviewed and discussed in this article. This approach uses the
allowed invariances of the Lagrangian and their associated anomaly cancellation
equations. We demonstrate that charge may be de-quantized in the
three-generation standard model with massless neutrinos, because differences in
family-lepton--numbers are anomaly-free. We also review the relevant
experimental limits. Our approach to charge quantization suggests that the
minimal standard model should be extended so that family-lepton--number
differences are explicitly broken. We briefly discuss some candidate extensions
(e.g. the minimal standard model augmented by Majorana right-handed neutrinos).

coupling is generated, and it can be large as $10^{-3}$. In the Left--Right
symmetric model both P conserving and violating couplings are generated. Due to
constraints on the $W_L$--$W_R$ mixing, these couplings are small.

geometrical meaning of topological Yang--Mills theory in terms of connections
and curvatures in an enlarged superspace; and its simple relationship to the
geometry of ordinary Yang--Mills theory. We also discover a certain SU(3)
triality between physical spacetime, and the two ghost directions of
superspace. Finally, we demonstrate how to recover the usual gauge-fixed
topological Yang--Mills action from our formalism.
