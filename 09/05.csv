susceptibility and the percolation order parameter indicate a transition at
$\beta = {1/e^2} = .205(5)$ with critical behavior in the universality class of
four dimensional percolation. We present accurate chiral condensate
measurements and monitor finite size effects carefully. The chiral condensate
data supports the existence of a power-law transition at $\beta = .205$ in the
same universality class as the chiral transition in the two flavor model. The
resulting equation of state predicts the mass ratio $m_\pi^2/m_\sigma^2$ in
good agreement with spectrum calculations while the hypothesis of a
logarithmically improved mean field theory fails qualitatively.

PCAC, correlation length scaling and the chiral equation of state. A scaling
theory for the ratio $R_\pi$ of the pion to sigma masses is presented. The
Goldstone character of the pion and properties of the longitudinal and
transverse chiral susceptibilities determine the ratio $R_\pi$ which can be
used to locate critical points and measure critical indices such as $\delta$.
We show how PCAC and correlation length scaling determine the pion mass'
dependence on the chiral condensate and lead to a practical method to measure
the anomalous dimension $\eta$. These tools are proving useful in studies of
the chiral transition in lattice QED and the quark-gluon plasma transition in
lattice QCD.

scalars lead to a very predictive neutrino spectrum. This comes about since the
standard model doublet contained in the {\bf 126} of Higgs (needed for the
see--saw mechanism) receives an induced vacuum expectation value at
tree--level, which, in addition to correcting the bad asymptotic mass relations
$m_d=m_e$ and $m_s=m_\mu$, also relates the Majorana neutrino mass matrix to
observables in the charged fermion sectors. We find that (i) the
$\nu_e-\nu_{\mu}$ mixing angle relevant for the solar neutrinos can be
considerably smaller than the Cabibbo angle and lies in the range ${\rm
sin}\theta_{e \mu}= 0-0.3$, (ii) $\nu_e-\nu_\tau$ mixing is sin$\theta_{e \tau}

large, ${\rm sin}\theta_{\mu \tau} \simeq 3|V_{cb}|=0.12-0.16$, and (iv)

corresponding set of conventional cuts. In this article we discuss another
pattern-recognition algorithm, the binary decision tree. We have applied a
binary decision tree to top quark identification at the Tevatron and found it
to be comparable in performance to the neural network. Furthermore,
reservations about the ""black box"" nature of neural network discriminators do
not apply to binary decision trees; a binary decision tree may be reduced to a
