the author that in a projective space of dimension at most 5, every
arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve which is cut out by quadrics scheme-
theoretically also has its homogeneous ideal generated by quadrics. In this
note it is shown that this is not the case in higher dimensional spaces.

single spin-2 field and fermionic fields of spin-3/2 are classified. Three new
cases are found: a `symplectic' family of superconformal algebras which are
extended by $su(2)\oplus sp(n)$, an $N=7$ and an $N=8$ superconformal algebra.
The exceptional cases can be viewed as arising a Drinfeld-Sokolov type
reduction of the exceptional Lie superalgebras $G(3)$ and $F(4)$, and have an
octonionic description. The quantum versions of the superconformal algebras are
constructed explicitly in all three cases.

"hep-th/9202062",,"Michael Wolf and Barton Zwiebach","The Plumbing of Minimal Area Metrics","38 pages, 5 figures (not included)",,,,"hep-th",,"  We study the metric of minimal area on a punctured Riemann surface under the
condition that all nontrivial homotopy closed curves be longer than or equal to
$2\pi$. By constructing deformations of admissible metrics we establish
necessary conditions on minimal area metrics and a partial converse to
Beurling's criterion for extremal metrics. We explicitly construct new minimal
area metrics that do not arise from quadratic differentials.
  Under the physically motivated assumption of existence of the minimal area
metrics, we show there exist neighborhoods of the punctures isometric to a flat
semiinfinite cylinder of circumference $2\pi$, allowing the definition of
canonical complex coordinates around the punctures. The plumbing of surfaces
with minimal area metrics is shown to induce a metric of minimal area on the
resulting surface. This implies that minimal area string diagrams define a
consistent quantum closed string field theory.

using a loop representation and shown to be equivalent to the standard Fock
quantization. Because it is based on coherent state methods, this framework may
be useful in quantum optics. It is also well-suited for the discussion of
issues related to flux quantization in condensed matter physics. Our own
motivation, however, came from a non-perturbative approach to quantum gravity.
The concrete results obtained in this paper for the Maxwell field provide
independent support for that approach. In addition, they offer some insight
into the physical interpretation of the mathematical structures that play,
within this approach, an essential role in the description of the quantum
geometry at Planck scale.

similar phenomenon occurs in the two-dimensional abelian chiral Higgs model. In
both cases anomalies (parity anomaly, gauge anomaly) are responsible of the
deconfinement mechanism.

algebra of vertex operators in 2d gravity. Polynomial potentials of orders only
strictly larger or smaller than 2 have no non--zero--energy polynomial
eigen--operators. This analysis leads us to consider a particular potential
$v(x)= \mu x^2 + g/x^2$. A Lie algebra of polynomial eigen--operators is then
constructed for this potential. It is a symmetric 2--index Lie algebra, also
