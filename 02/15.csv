results aimed at determining the Picard number of such a surface. For the
surfaces considered, this will be equivalent to determining the Mordell-Weil
rank of an elliptic curve defined over a function field in one variable. An
interesting conjecture concerning Galois actions on the relative de~Rham
cohomology of these surfaces is discussed.

  Theory","30 pages","Commun.Math.Phys. 150 (1992) 83-108","10.1007/BF02096567",,"hep-th math.QA",,"  We show how to construct, starting from a quasi-Hopf algebra, or
quasi-quantum group, invariants of knots and links. In some cases, these
invariants give rise to invariants of the three-manifolds obtained by surgery
along these links. This happens for a finite-dimensional quasi-quantum group,
whose definition involves a finite group $G$, and a 3-cocycle $\om$, which was
first studied by Dijkgraaf, Pasquier and Roche. We treat this example in more
detail, and argue that in this case the invariants agree with the partition
function of the topological field theory of Dijkgraaf and Witten depending on
the same data $G, \,\om$.

description, in terms of a Calabi-Yau manifold, and also the quantum theory is
known in terms of a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold model. In particular, we study
(smooth) Calabi-Yau examples in which there are obstructions to parametrizing
all of the complex structure cohomology by polynomial deformations thus
requiring the analysis based on exact and spectral sequences. General arguments
ensure that the Landau-Ginzburg chiral ring copes with such a situation by
having a nontrivial contribution from twisted sectors. Beyond the expected
final agreement between the mathematical and physical approaches, we find a
direct correspondence between the analysis of each, thus giving a more complete
mathematical understanding of twisted sectors. Furthermore, this approach shows
that physical reasoning based upon spectral flow arguments for determining the
spectrum of Landau-Ginzburg orbifold models finds direct mathematical
justification in Koszul complex calculations and also that careful point- field
analysis continues to recover suprisingly much of the stringy features.
