  Hong Kong, 1992, pp. 241-264",,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We describe a strategy for computing Yukawa couplings and the mirror map,
based on the Picard-Fuchs equation. (Our strategy is a variant of the method
used by Candelas, de la Ossa, Green, and Parkes in the case of quintic
hypersurfaces.) We then explain a technique of Griffiths which can be used to
compute the Picard-Fuchs equations of hypersurfaces. Finally, we carry out the
computation for four specific examples (including quintic hypersurfaces,
previously done by Candelas et al.). This yields predictions for the number of
rational curves of various degrees on certain hypersurfaces in weighted
projective spaces. Some of these predictions have been confirmed by classical
techniques in algebraic geometry.

"hep-th/9202086","Ergin Sezgin","E. Sezgin","Area-Preserving Diffeomorphisms, w_\infty Algebras and w_\infty Gravity","24 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  The w_\infty algebra is a particular generalization of the Virasoro algebra
with generators of higher spin 2,3,...,\infty. It can be viewed as the algebra
of a class of functions, relative to a Poisson bracket, on a suitably chosen
surface. Thus, w_\infty is a special case of area-preserving diffeomorphisms of
an arbitrary surface. We review various aspects of area- preserving
diffeomorphisms, w_\infty algebras and w_\infty gravity. The topics covered
include a) the structure of the algebra of area-preserving diffeomorphisms with
central extensions and their relation to w_\infty algebras, b) various
generalizations of w_\infty algebras, c) the structure of w_\infty gravity and
its geometrical aspects, d) nonlinear realizations of w_\infty symmetry and e)
various quantum realizations of w_\infty symmetry.

in heterotic and closed superstring field theory. The operators required for
this purpose are shown to satisfy a set of descent equations.
