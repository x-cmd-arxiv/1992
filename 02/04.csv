models. We prove an equivalence of the models with the potentials
$\tr{({1/over2N}X^2 + \log X - \Lambda X)}$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty t_k\tr{X^k}$
providing the matrix $\Lambda$ is related to $\{t_k\}$ by $t_k=\fr 1k
\tr{\Lambda^{-k}}-\frac N2 \delta_{k2}$. Based on this equivalence we formulate
a method for calculating the partition function by solving the Schwinger--Dyson
equations order by order of genus expansion. Explicit calculations of the
partition function and of correlators of conformal operators with the puncture
operator are presented in genus one. These results support the conjecture that
our models are associated with the $c=1$ case in the same sense as the
Kontsevich model describes $c=0$.

B391 (1993) 409-462","10.1016/0550-3213(93)90154-H",,"hep-th",,"  We construct the K=8 fractional superconformal algebras. There are two such
extended Virasoro algebras, one of which was constructed earlier, involving a
fractional spin (equivalently, conformal dimension) 6/5 current. The new
algebra involves two additional fractional spin currents with spin 13/5. Both
algebras are non-local and satisfy non-abelian braiding relations. The
construction of the algebras uses the isomorphism between the Z_8 parafermion
theory and the tensor product of two tricritical Ising models. For the special
value of the central charge c=52/55, corresponding to the eighth member of the
unitary minimal series, the 13/5 currents of the new algebra decouple, while
two spin 23/5 currents (level-2 current algebra descendants of the 13/5
currents) emerge. In addition, it is shown that the K=8 algebra involving the
spin 13/5 currents at central charge c=12/5 is the appropriate algebra for the
construction of the K=8 (four-dimensional) fractional superstring.

symmetries in the matter sector. Even before coupling to gravity, the
topological torus has an infinite number of point-like physical observables,
which give rise via the BRST descent equations to an infinite symmetry algebra
of the model. The point-like observables of ghost number zero form a
topological ground ring, whose generators span a spacetime manifold; the
symmetry algebra represents all (ground ring valued) diffeomorphisms of the
spacetime. At nonzero ghost numbers, the topological ground ring is extended to
a superring, the spacetime manifold becomes a supermanifold, and the symmetry
algebra preserves a symplectic form on it. In a decompactified limit of
cylindrical target topology, we find a nilpotent charge which behaves like a
spacetime topological BRST operator. After coupling to topological gravity,
this model might represent a topological phase of $c=1$ string theory. We also
point out some analogies to two dimensional superstrings with the chiral GSO
projection, and to string theory with $c=-2$.
