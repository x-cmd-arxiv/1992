equations of the form {\it monomial = monomial}. For a good brief survey of the
history and role of toric varieties see [10]. Any toric variety $X$ contains a
cover by affine open sets described in terms of arrangements (called fans) of
convex bodies in $\Bbb R^r$. The coordinate rings of each of these affine open
sets is a graded ring generated over the ground field by monomials. As a
consequence, toric varieties provide a good context in which cohomology can be
calculated. The purpose of this article is to describe the second \'etale
cohomology group with coefficients in the sheaf of units of any toric variety
$X$. This is the so-called cohomological Brauer group of $X$.

between the k-instantons of a Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $G$ and the
holomorphic maps from $CP_1$ to $\Omega G$. Since then, Nair and Mazur, have
associated the $\Theta $ vacua structure in QCD with self-intersecting Riemann
surfaces immersed in four dimensions. From here they concluded that these 2D
surfaces correspond to the non-perturbative phase of QCD and carry the
topological information of the $\Theta$ vacua. In this paper we would like to
elaborate on this point by making use of Atiyah's identification. We will argue
that an effective description of QCD may be more like a $WZW$ model coupled to
the induced metric of an immersion of a 2-D Riemann surface in $R^4$. We make
some further comments on the relationship between the coadjoint orbits of the
Kac-Moody group on $G$ and instantons with axial symmetry and monopole charge.

"hep-th/9202067",,"Mirjam Cvetic","Stringy Domain Walls and Other Stringy Topological Defects","16 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  We point out that the moduli sector of the $(2,2)$ string compactification
with its nonperturbatively preserved non-compact symmetries is a framework to
study global topological defects. Based on the target space modular invariance
of the nonperturbative superpotential of the four-dimensional $N=1$
supersymmetric string vacua, topologically stable stringy domain walls are
found. Explicit supersymmetric solutions for the modulus field and the metric,
which saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, are presented. They interpolate between
{\it non-degenerate} vacua. As a corollary, this defines a new notion of vacuum
degeneracy of supersymmetric vacua. Nonsupersymmetric stringy domain walls are
discussed as well. The moduli sectors with more than one modulus and the
non-compact continous symmetry preserved allow for global monopole-type and
texture-type configurations.

By introducing matter sources in the field equations we show how such objects
can arise as the endpoint of gravitational collapse. We examine the motion of
test particles outside the horizons, and show that they fall through in a
finite amount of proper time and an infinite amount of coordinate time. We also
investigate the thermodynamic and quantum properties, which give rise to a
fundamental length scale. The 't Hooft prescription for cutting off eigenmodes
of particle wave functions is shown to be source dependent, unlike the
four-dimensional case. The relationship between these black holes and those
considered previously in $(1+1)$ dimensions is discussed.

nonsimply-laced cases. For specific examples, namely the spin-3 current for the

thus establishing the existence of factorized S-matrices. For these theories,
as well as the simply-laced $a_2^{(1)}$ theory, we compute one-loop corrections
to the corresponding higher-spin charges and study charge conservation for the
three-particle vertex function. For the $a_3^{(2)}$ theory we show that
although the current is conserved, anomalous threshold singularities spoil the
conservation of the corresponding charge for the on-shell vertex function,
implying a breakdown of some of the bootstrap procedures commonly used in
determining the exact S-matrix.
