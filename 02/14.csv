chiral bosons. The model is based on the idea that the chiral condition could
be implemented through a linear constraint. We show that the space of states is
of indefinite metric. We cure this disease by introducing ghost fields in such
a way that a BRST symmetry is generated. A quartet algebra is seen to emerge.
The quartet mechanism, then, forces all physical states, but the vacuum, to
have zero norm.

  19Feb2001",,,,"hep-th math.GR math.QA",,"  We pose a representation-theoretic question motivated by an attempt to
resolve the Andrews-Curtis conjecture. Roughly, is there a triangular Hopf
algebra with a collection of self-dual irreducible representations $V_i$ so
that the product of any two decomposes as a sum of copies of the $V_i$, and
$\sum (\rank V_i)^2=0$? This data can be used to construct a `topological
quantum field theory' on 2-complexes which stands a good chance of detecting
counterexamples to the conjecture.

duality and the associated duality anomaly cancellations on orbifold-like 4-D
strings. A prominent role is played by the modular weights of the massless
fields. We present a general classification of all possible modular weights of
massless fields in Abelian orbifolds. We show that the cancellation of modular
anomalies strongly constrains the massless fermion content of the theory, in
close analogy with the standard ABJ anomalies. We emphasize the validity of
this approach not only for (2,2) orbifolds but for (0,2) models with and
without Wilson lines. As an application one can show that one cannot build a
${\bf Z}_3$ or ${\bf Z}_7$ orbifold whose massless charged sector with respect
to the (level one) gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ is that of the
minimal supersymmetric standard model, since any such model would necessarily
have duality anomalies. A general study of those constraints for Abelian
orbifolds is presented. Duality anomalies are also related to the computation
of string threshold corrections to gauge coupling constants. We present an
analysis of the possible relevance of those threshold corrections to the
computation of $\sin^2\theta_W$ and $\alpha_3$ for all Abelian orbifolds. Some
particular {\it minimal} scenarios, namely those based on all ${\bf Z}_N$
orbifolds except ${\bf Z}_6$

  2D supergravity",,,,,"hep-th",,"  String field theory for the non-critical NSR string is described. In
particular it gives string field theory for the 2D super-gravity coupled to a
$\hat{c}=1$ matter field. For this purpose double-step pictures changing
operators for the non-critical NSR string are constructed. Analogues of the
critical supersymmetry transformations are written for $D<10$, they form a
closed on-shell algebra, however their action on vertices is defined only for
discrete value of the Liouville momentum. For D=2 this means that spinor
massless field has its superpartner in the NS sector only if its momentum is
fixed.
  Starting from string field theory we calculate string amplitudes. These
amplitudes for D=2 have poles which are related with discrete set of primary
fields, namely 2R$\to$2R amplitude has poles corresponding to the n-level NS
excitations with discrete momenta $p_1=n,~~p_2=-1\pm (n+1)$.

proposed for a system of point particles which does not require relativity or
field theory, but assumes the existence of antiparticles. We extend this proof
to a system of string loops in three space dimensions and show that by assuming
the existence of antistring loops, one can prove a spin-statistics theorem for
these string loops. According to this theorem, all unparametrized strings(such
as flux tubes in superconductors and cosmic strings ) should be quantized as
bosons. Also, as in the point particle case, we find that the theorem excludes
nonabelian statistics.
