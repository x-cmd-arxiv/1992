"alg-geom/9202021",,"Dave Bayer, Andre Galligo, Mike Stillman","Grobner bases and extension of scalars","18 pages, LaTeX",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  This paper studies the behavior of Grobner bases with respect to extensions
of scalars. We prove that an extension of scalars commutes with taking Grobner
bases iff the extension is flat. We consider what information can be deduced
about fibers of a family, from the Grobner basis of the defining ideal of the
family itself. This information can be used to construct algorithms, such as to
find locii over which a map is finite, or an isomorphism.

version of a talk given by the author at the Motives conference. Topics covered
include, monodromy; the polylogarithm local systems; Bloch's constructions of
regulators using the dilogarithm; polylog locals systems as variations of mixed
Hodge structre; the polylogarithm quotient of the fundamental group of C -
{0,}. It is intended as background for understanding recent work of Beilinson,
Deligne, and Goncharov.

result of the old version (the equality, up to a factor of 2 of the Beilinson
and Borel regulators) is now a conjecture. The main results give equality of
Beilinson chern classes and Cheeger-Simons-Chern classes in various situations
such as for flat bundles over quasi projective varieties. We also prove the
equality (up to a factor of two) of the Borel regulator element and the
universal Cheeger-Simons Chern class.

When the gauge group is $SU_q(2)$, $q^n=1,$ it is the Turaev-Viro invariant and
the model may be regarded as a non-perturbative definition of $3d$ simplicial
quantum gravity. If one takes a finite abelian group $G$, the corresponding
invariant gives the rank of the first cohomology group of a complex
\nolinebreak $C$: $I_G(C) = rank(H^1(C,G))$, which means a topological
expansion in the Betti number $b^1$. In general, it is a theory of the
Dijkgraaf-Witten type, $i.e.$ determined completely by the fundamental group of
a manifold.
