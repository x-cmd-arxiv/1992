  martingales with values in banach spaces",,,,"Banach Archive 2/28/92","math.FA",,"  For a Banach space X we define RUMD_n(X) to be the infimum of all c>0 such
that (AVE_{\epsilon_k =\pm 1} || \sum_1^n epsilon_k (M_k - M_{k-1}
)||_{L_2^X}^2 )^{1/2} <= c || M_n ||_{L_2^X} holds for all Walsh-Paley
martingales {M_k}_0^n subset L_2^X with M_0 =0. We relate the asymptotic
behaviour of the sequence {RUMD(X)}_{n=1}^{infinity} to geometrical properties
of the Banach space X such as K-convexity and superreflexivity.

"math/9202204","Dale E. Alspach","Dale E. Alspach and Spiros Argyros","Complexity of weakly null sequences",,,,"Banach Archive 2/28/92","math.FA",,"  We introduce an ordinal index which measures the complexity of a weakly null
sequence, and show that a construction due to J. Schreier can be iterated to
produce for each alpha < omega_1, a weakly null sequence (x^{alpha}_n)_n in
C(omega^{omega^{alpha}})) with complexity alpha. As in the Schreier example
each of these is a sequence of indicator functions which is a suppression-1
unconditional basic sequence. These sequences are used to construct
Tsirelson-like spaces of large index. We also show that this new ordinal index
is related to the Lavrentiev index of a Baire-1 function and use the index to
sharpen some results of Alspach and Odell on averaging weakly null sequences.
