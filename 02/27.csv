the ``topology'' of a smooth projective variety and a (``general'') hyperplane
section. Recent results of Nori produce cohomological evidence for a conjecture
that a general hypersurface of sufficently large degree should have no
``interesting'' cycles. We compute precise bounds for these results and show by
example that there are indeed interesting cycles for degrees that are not high
enough. In a different direction Esnault, Nori and Srinivas have shown
connectivity for intersections of small multidegree. We show analogous
cycle-theoretic connectivity results.

of A. I. Mal'tsev, Novosibirsk, USSR, 1989 (to appear in Contemporary
Mathematics). The concept of a divisor with complex coefficients on an
algebraic curve is introduced. We consider families of complex divisors, or,
equivalently, families of invertible sheaves and define Arakelov-type metrics
on some invertible sheaves produced from them on the base. We apply this
technique to obtain a formula for the measure on the moduli space that gives
tachyon correlators in string theory.

  Vector Fields","25 page",,,,"hep-th math.GT",,"  We define the concepts of topological particles and topological radiation.
These are nothing more than connected components of defects of a vector field.
To each topological particle we assign an index which is an integer which is
conserved under interactions with other particles much as electric charge is
conserved. For space-like vector fields of space-times this index is invariant
under all coordinate transformations. We propose the following physical
principal: For physical vector fields the index changes only when there is
radiation. As an implication of this principal we predict that any physical
psuedo-vector field has index zero. The definition of the index is quite
elementary. It only depends upon the concepts of continuity, compactness, the
Euler-Poincare number, and the idea of inward pointing. The proof that this
definition is well defined takes up most of the paper. The paper concludes with
a list of properties of the index.

super Liouville theory coupled to matter fields in the super Coulomb gas
formulation, on world sheets with spherical topology. After integrating over
the zero mode and assuming that the $s$ parameter takes an integer value, we
subsequently continue it to an arbitrary real number and compute the
correlators in a closed form. We also included an arbitrary number of screening
charges and, as a result, after renormalizing them, as well as the external
legs and the cosmological constant, the form of the final amplitudes do not
modify. The result is remarkably parallel to the bosonic case. For
completeness, we discussed the calculation of bosonic correlators including
arbitrary screening charges.

apparent ease with which such systems may be formed in general relativity,
given relatively benign initial conditions such as the existence of traversable
wormholes or of infinite cosmic strings. This rather disturbing state of
affairs has led Hawking to formulate his Chronology Protection Conjecture,
whereby the formation of ``time machines'' is forbidden. This paper will use
several simple examples to argue that the universe appears to exhibit a
``defense in depth'' strategy in this regard. For appropriate parameter regimes
Casimir effects, wormhole disruption effects, and gravitational back reaction
effects all contribute to the fight against time travel. Particular attention
is paid to the role of the quantum gravity cutoff. For the class of model
problems considered it is shown that the gravitational back reaction becomes
large before the Planck scale quantum gravity cutoff is reached, thus
supporting Hawking's conjecture.
