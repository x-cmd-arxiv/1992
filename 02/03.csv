interpreted as conformal blocks of two-dimensional conformal field theory.
Fractional statistics can be extended to nonabelian statistics and examples can
be constructed from conformal field theory. The Pfaffian state is related to
the 2D Ising model and possesses fractionally charged excitations which are
predicted to obey nonabelian statistics.

$G_L\otimes G_R$. In the standard gauged WZW theory, vector gauge fields (\ie\
with vector gauge couplings) are in the adjoint representation of the subgroup
$H \subset G$. In this paper, we show that, in the conformal limit in two
dimensions, there is a gauged WZW theory where the gauge fields are chiral and
belong to the subgroups $H_L$ and $H_R$ where $H_L$ and $H_R$ can be different
groups. In the special case where $H_L=H_R$, the theory is equivalent to vector
gauged WZW theory. For general groups $H_L$ and $H_R$, an examination of the
correlation functions (or more precisely, conformal blocks) shows that the
chiral gauged WZW theory is equivalent to $(G/H)_L\otimes (G/H)_R$ coset models
in conformal field theory. The equivalence of the vector gauged WZW theory and
the corresponding $G/H$ coset theory then follows.

hole is investigated near the extremal limit at which the mass is a constant
times the charge. Near this limit a neighborhood of the horizon of the black
hole is closely approximated by a trivial product of a two-dimensional black
hole with a sphere. This is shown to imply that the scattering of
long-wavelength particles can be described by a (previously analyzed)
two-dimensional effective field theory, and is related to the
formation/evaporation of two-dimensional black holes. The scattering proceeds
via particle capture followed by Hawking re-emission, and naively appears to
violate unitarity. However this conclusion can be altered when the effects of
backreaction are included. Particle-hole scattering is discussed in the light
of a recent analysis of the two-dimensional backreaction problem. It is argued
that the quantum mechanical possibility of scattering off of extremal black
holes implies the potential existence of additional quantum numbers - referred
to as ``quantum whiskers'' - characterizing the black hole.
