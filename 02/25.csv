the electroweak phase transition. This includes a determination of the nature
of the phase transition, a discussion of the possible role of higher order
radiative corrections and the theory of the formation and evolution of the
bubbles of the new phase. We find in particular that no dangerous linear terms
appear in the effective potential. However, the strength of the first order
phase transition is 2/3 times less than what follows from the one-loop
approximation. This rules out baryogenesis in the minimal version of the
electroweak theory.

"hep-th/9202082",,"Haye Hinrichsen and Vladimir Rittenberg","The Pokrovski-Talapov Phase Transitions and Quantum Groups","9 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  We show that the XY quantum chain in a magnetic field is invariant under a
two parameter deformation of the $SU(1/1)$ superalgebra. One is led to an
extension of the braid group and the Hecke algebras which reduce to the known
ones when the two parameter coincide. The physical significance of the two
parameters is discussed. When both are equal to one, one gets a
Pokrovski-Talapov phase transition. We also show that the representation theory
of the quantum superalgebras indicates how to take the appropriate
thermodynamical limits.

B392 (1993) 551-592","10.1016/0550-3213(93)90517-S",,"hep-th",,"  It has recently been shown that the dissipative Hofstadter model (dissipative
quantum mechanics of an electron subject to uniform magnetic field and periodic
potential in two dimensions) exhibits critical behavior on a network of lines
in the dissipation/magnetic field plane. Apart from their obvious condensed
matter interest, the corresponding critical theories represent non-trivial
solutions of open string field theory, and a detailed account of their
properties would be interesting from several points of view. A subject of
particular interest is the dependence of physical quantities on the magnetic
field since it, much like $\theta_{\rm QCD}$, serves only to give relative
phases to different sectors of the partition sum. In this paper we report the
results of an initial investigation of the free energy, $N$-point functions and
boundary state of this type of critical theory. Although our primary goal is
the study of the magnetic field dependence of these quantities, we will present
some new results which bear on the zero magnetic field case as well.
