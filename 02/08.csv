non-integrable holomorphic distribution. A contact curve on a contact threefold
is an integrable curve of the distribution. This work was inspired by two
papers of Bryant, in which he used complex contact geometry to study
superminimal surfaces in four-sphere and to investigate exotic holonomies. The
present paper is devoted to systematical studies of contact threefold and
contact curves on them. We generalize a result of Bryant and answer a question
of his.

a Chern-Simons term using the $1/N$ expansion. The $\beta$-function for the CS
coefficient $\theta$ is found to be zero to order $1/N$ in the unbroken phase
by an explicit calculation. It is argued to be zero to all orders. Some remarks
on the $\theta$ dependence of the critical exponents are also made.

"hep-th/9202027",,"G. Nagao","A Conformal Field Theory for the Quantum Hall Effect","15 pgs",,,,"hep-th",,"  The QHE is studied in the context of a CFT. An effective field of $N$
``spins"" associated with the cyclotron motion of particles is taken as an order
parameter from which an effective Hamiltonian may be defined. This effective
Hamiltonian describes the COM motion of the $N$ particles (with coupling
$\kappa_0$) together with a current-current interaction (of strength
$\kappa_1$). Such a system gives rise to a CFT in the large $N$ limit when
$\kappa_0 = \kappa_1$. The Laughlin wavefunction is derived from this CFT as an
$N'$-point correlation function of winding state vertex operators.

which corresponds to the $(2p-q,p)$ minimal CFT. The perturbing field near the
new IR fixed point is identified with the irrelevent $\Phi_{3,1}$ operator. We
extend this result to show that the non-diagonal ($(A,D)$-type) modular
invariant partition function of the $(p,q)$ minimal CFT flows into the
$(A,D)$-type partition function of the $(2p-q,p)$ minimal CFT and the diagonal
partition function into the diagonal.

show that the Halperin-Haldane SQHE wave function can be written in the form of
a product of a wave function for charged semions in a magnetic field and a wave
function for the Chiral Spin Liquid of neutral spin-$\12$ semions. We introduce
field-theoretic model in which the electron operators are factorized in terms
of charged spinless semions (holons) and neutral spin-$\12$ semions (spinons).
Broken time reversal symmetry and short ranged spin correlations lead to
$SU(2)_{k=1}$ Chern-Simons term in Landau-Ginzburg action for SQHE phase. We
construct appropriate coherent states for SQHE phase and show the existence of
$SU(2)$ valued gauge potential. This potential appears as a result of ``spin
rigidity"" of the ground state against any displacements of nodes of wave
function from positions of the particles and reflects the nontrivial monodromy
in the presence of these displacements.
