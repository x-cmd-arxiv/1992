predicts the number of rational curves on the generic quintic threefold. Our
account involves the interpretation of Yukawa couplings in terms of variations
of Hodge structure, a new $q$-expansion principle for functions on the moduli
space of Calabi-Yau manifolds, and the ``mirror symmetry'' phenomenon recently
observed by string theorists.

"alg-geom/9202005","Guenter Ziegler","G\""unter M. Ziegler","On the difference between real and complex arrangements","13 pages, plain-TeX, C-Version 3.14",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  Let $B$ be an arrangement of linear complex hyperplanes in $C^d$. Then a
classical result by Orlik \& Solomon asserts that the cohomology algebra of the
complement can be constructed from the combinatorial data that are given by the
intersection lattice.
  If $B'$ is, more generally, a $2$-arrangement in $R^{2d}$ (an arrangement of
real subspaces of codimension $2$ with even-dimensional intersections), then
the intersection lattice still determines the cohomology {\it groups} of the
complement, as was shown by Goresky \& MacPherson. We prove, however, that for
$2$-arrangements the cohomology {\it algebra} is not determined by the
intersection lattice. It encodes extra information on sign patterns, which can
be computed from determinants of linear relations or, equivalently, from
linking coefficients in the sense of knot theory. This also allows us (in the
case $d=2$) to identify arrangements with the same lattice but different
fundamental groups.

infinite volume) can contain particles, known as kinks, which interpolate
between different vacua and have nontrivial restrictions on their
multi-particle Hilbert space. Assuming such a theory to be integrable, we show
how to calculate the multi-kink energy levels in finite volume given its
factorizable $S$-matrix. In massive theories this can be done exactly up to
contributions due to off-shell and tunneling effects that fall off
exponentially with volume. As a first application we compare our analytical
predictions for the kink scattering theories conjectured to describe the
subleading thermal and magnetic perturbations of the tricritical Ising model
with numerical results from the truncated conformal space approach. In
particular, for the subleading magnetic perturbation our results allow us to
decide between the two different $S$-matrices proposed by Smirnov and
Zamolodchikov.
