between the chiral $n$-point functions, as well as the equations governing
them, of the $A_1^{(1)}$ WZNW conformal theory and the corresponding Virasoro
minimal models. The WZNW correlators are described as solutions of the Knizhnik
- Zamolodchikov equations with rational levels and isospins. The technical tool
exploited are certain relations in twisted cohomology. The results extend to
arbitrary level $k+2 \neq 0$ and isospin values of the type $J=j-j'(k+2)$, $ \
2j, 2j' \in Z\!\!\!Z_+$.

"hep-th/9201081",,"Adrian R. Lugo","Comments on Gauged WZW Models","7 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  Some remarks are made about free anomaly groups in gauged WZW models.
Considering a quite general action, anomaly cancellation is analyzed. The
possibility of gauging left and right sectors independently in some cases is
remarked. In particular Toda theories can be seen as such a kind of models.

analytic mappings in infinite dimension is sketched. Infinite dimensional
manifolds are discussed with special emphasis on smooth partitions of unity and
tangent vectors as derivations. Manifolds of mappings and diffeomorphisms are
treated. Finally the differential structure on the inductive limits of the
groups $GL(n)$, $SO(n)$ and some of their homogeneus spaces is treated.

  a connection",,"Lecture Notes in Math. 1410 (1989), 249-261",,"Michor 99-08","math.DG",,"  In the main part of this paper a connection is just a fiber projection onto a
(not necessarily integrable) distribution or sub vector bundle of the tangent
bundle. Here curvature is computed via the Froelicher-Nijenhuis bracket, and it
is complemented by cocurvature and the Bianchi identity still holds. In this
situation we determine the graded Lie algebra of all graded derivations over
the horizontal projection of a connection and we determine their commutation
relations. Finally, for a principal connection on a principal bundle and the
induced connection on an associated bundle we show how one may pass from one to
the other. The final results relate derivations on vector bundle valued forms
and derivations over the horizontal projection of the algebra of forms on the
principal bundle with values in the standard vector space.
