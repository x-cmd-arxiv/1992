\Zn\ symmetry. They have exact soliton masses given by the affine $SU(n)$ Toda
masses and fractional fermion numbers given by multiples of $1/n$. The basic
such $N$=2 integrable theory is the $A_n$-type $N$=2 minimal model perturbed by
the most relevant operator. The soliton content and exact S-matrices are
obtained using the Landau-Ginzburg description. We study the thermodynamics of
these theories and calculate the ground-state energies exactly, verifying that
they have the correct conformal limits. We conjecture that the soliton content
and S-matrices in other integrable \Zn\ $N$=2 theories are given by the tensor
product of the above basic $N$=2 \Zn\ scattering theory with various $N$=0
theories. In particular, we consider integrable perturbations of $N$=2
Kazama-Suzuki models described by generalized Chebyshev potentials, $CP^{n-1}$
sigma models, and $N$=2 sine-Gordon and its affine Toda generalizations.

two-dimensional motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field,
constrained in the lowest Landau level, we formulate a system of one-dimen-
sional nonrelativistic fermions by using a Chern-Simons field theory in 2+1
dimensions. Using a hydrodynamical formulation we obtain a two-dimensional
droplet picture of one-dimensional fermions. The dynamics involved is that of
the boundary between a uniform density of particles and vortices. We use the
sharp boundary approximation. In the case of well separated boundaries we
derive the one-dimensional collective field Hamiltonian. Symmetries of the
theory are also discussed as properties of curves in two dimensions.

supersymmetry algebra is suggested. Resulting physical systems do not have
conserved charges and degeneracies in the spectra. Instead, superpartner
Hamiltonians are q-isospectral, i.e. the spectrum of one can be obtained from
another by the q^2-factor scaling. A special class of the self-similar
potentials is shown to obey the dynamical conformal symmetry algebra su_q(1,1).
These potentials exhibit exponential spectra and corresponding raising and
lowering operators satisfy the q-deformed harmonic oscillator algebra of
Biedenharn and Macfarlane.

quantum mechanical objects, depend both on the parameters of the hole and on
the microscopic theory in which it is embedded. A thermal description is
inadequate for extremal holes. In particular, extreme holes of the charged
dilaton family can have zero entropy but non-zero, and even (for $a>1$)
formally infinite, temperature. The existence of a tendency to radiate at the
extreme, which threatens to overthrow any attempt to identify the entropy as
available internal states and also to expose a naked singularity, is at first
sight quite disturbing. However by analyzing the perturbations around the
extreme holes we show that these holes are protected by mass gaps, or
alternatively potential barriers, which remove them from thermal contact with
the external world. We suggest that the behavior of these extreme dilaton black
holes, which from the point of view of traditional black hole theory seems
quite bizarre, can reasonably be interpreted as the holes doing their best to
behave like normal elementary particles. The $a<1$ holes behave qualitatively
as extended objects.

string diagrams of the latter define a new decomposition of the moduli spaces
of Riemann surfaces with punctures and boundaries based on quadratic
differentials with both first order and second order poles.
