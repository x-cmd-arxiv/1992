families of such singularities, distinguished by Koll{\'a}r's {\em length}

small resolutions. As a by-product, generators of the ring of invariants are
given for the standard action of the Weyl group of each of the irreducible root
systems.

simple example and leads to a new exactly soluble model. This work is a step
towards the construction of a strong coupling perturbation theory for quantum
gravity.

  Mirror Symmetry at MSRI",,,,"hep-th math.AG",,"  By considering mirror symmetry applied to conformal field theories
corresponding to strings propagating in quintic hypersurfaces in projective
4-space, Candelas, de la Ossa, Green and Parkes calculated the ``number of
rational curves on the hypersurface'' by comparing three point functions.
Actually, the number of curves may be infinite for special examples; what is
really being calculated is a path integral. The point of this talk is to give
mathematical techniques and examples for computing the finite number that
``should'' correspond to an infinite family of curves (which coincides with
that given by the path integral in every known instance), and to suggest that
these techniques should provide the answer to the not yet solved problem of how
to calculate instanton corrections to the three point function in general.

cosmological constant in terms of the Ashtekar new variables in the connection

from the Ashtekar connection and has an associated metric in spacetime that is
everywhere nondegenerate. We then transform this state to the loop
representation and find solutions to all the constraint equations for
intersecting loops. These states are given by suitable generalizations of the
Jones knot polynomial for the case of intersecting knots. These are the first
physical states of Quantum Gravity for which an explicit form is known both in
the connection and loop representations. Implications of this result are also
discussed.

The interactions occur on the one-dimensional line of hermitian matrix
eigenvalues. The field is conjugate to the density of matrix eigenvalues which
appears in the Jevicki-Sakita collective field theory. The classical solution
of the field equation is either unique or labeled by a discrete index. Such a
solution corresponds to the Dyson sea modified by an entropy term. The
modification smoothes the sea edges, and interpolates between different
eigenvalue bands for multiple-well potentials. Our classical eigenvalue density
contains nonplanar effects, and satisfies a local nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equation with similarities to the Marinari-Parisi $D=1$ reformulation. The
quantum fluctuations about a classical solution are computable, and the IR and
UV divergences are manifestly removed to all orders. The quantum corrections
greatly simplify in the double scaling limit, and include both
string-perturbative and nonperturbative effects.
