string theory. It is shown that all tree-level Ward identities can be
summarized in a quadratic differential equation for the generating function of
tree-amplitudes. This result is extended to loop amplitudes and leads to a
master equation {\it \`{a} la} Batalin-Vilkovisky for the complete partition
function.

"hep-th/9202022","Konstantinos Anagnostopoulos","Lee Smolin","Recent Developments in Non-Perturbative Quantum Gravity","82 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  New results from the new variables/loop representation program of
nonperturbative quantum gravity are presented, with a focus on results of
Ashtekar, Rovelli and the author which greatly clarify the physical
interpretation of the quantum states in the loop representation. These include:
1) The construction of a class of states which approximate smooth metrics for
length measurements on scales, $L$, to order $l_{Planck}/L$. 2) The discovery
that any such state must have discrete structure at the Planck length. 3) The
construction of operators for the area of arbitrary surfaces and volumes of
arbitrary regions and the discovery that these operators are finite. 4) The
diagonalization of these operators and the demonstration that the spectra are
discrete, so that in quantum gravity areas and volumes are quantized in Planck
units. 5) The construction of finite diffeomorphism invariant operators that
measure geometrical quantities such as the volume of the universe and the areas
of minimal surfaces. These results are made possible by the use of new
techniques for the regularization of operator products that respect
diffeomorphism invariance. Several new results in the classical theory are also
reviewed including the solution of the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism
constraints in closed form of Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson and a new form of
the action that induces Chern-Simon theory on the boundaries of spacetime. A
new classical discretization of the Einstein equations is also presented.

  Absence of $\omega M$ Effects","29pp","Phys.Rev. D46 (1992) 2497-2506","10.1103/PhysRevD.46.2497",,"hep-th",,"  We consider a source of gravitational waves of frequency $\omega$, located
near the center of a massive galaxy of mass $M$ and radius $R$, with $\omega\gg
R^{-1}$. In the case of a perfect fluid galaxy, and of odd-parity waves, there
is no direct matter-wave interaction and the propagation of the waves is
affected by the galaxy only through the curvature of the spacetime background
through which the waves propagate. We find that, in addition to the expected
redshift of the radiation emerging from the galaxy, there is a small amount of
backscatter, of order $M/\omega^2R^3$. We show that there is no suppression of
radiative power by the factor $1+\omega^2M^2/4$ as has been recently predicted
by Kundu. The origin of Kundu's suppression lies in the interpretation of a
term in the expansion of the exterior field of the galaxy in inverse powers of
radius. It is shown why that term is not related to the source strength or to
the strength of the emerging radiation.

particles with spin. Introducing the notion of {\em charged} winding number in
the super-plane, we represent the braid group generators as homotopically
constrained Feynman kernels. In this framework, super Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
operators appear naturally in the Hamiltonian, suggesting the possibility of
{\em spinning nonabelian} anyons. We then apply our formulation to the study of
fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). A systematic discussion of the ground
states and their quasi-hole excitations is given. We obtain Laughlin, Halperin
and Moore-Read states as {\em exact} ground state solutions to the respective
Hamiltonians associated to the braid group representations. The energy gap of
the quasi-excitation is also obtainable from this approach.

theories in the Brink-Di Vecchia-Howe-Polyakov (BDHP) formulation, and argue
that the same phenomenon holds in string theories. In particular it is shown,
that the naive BRST formulation of the BDHP theory leads to trivial quantum
field theories with vanishing correlation functions.
