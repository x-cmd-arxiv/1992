that a reduced algebraic plane curve is regular at infinity if and only if its
link at infinity is a regular toral link. This conjecture has also been proved
by Ha H.~V. using Lojasiewicz numbers at infinity. Our first proof uses the
polar invariant and the second proof uses linear systems of plane curve
singularities. The second approach (based on a paper in preparation) also
proves a stronger conjecture (loc. cit.) describing topologically the regular
link at infinity associated with an irregular link at infinity.

characteristic $p>0$. We assume the presence of a Frobenius splitting. (See
V.B. Mehta and A. Ramanathan, Frobenius splitting and cohomology vanishing for
Schubert varieties, Annals of Math. 122 (1985), 27--40). The main result is
that a non-zero higher direct image under a proper map of the ideal sheaf of a
compatibly Frobenius split subvariety can not have a support whose inverse
image is contained in that subvariety. Earlier vanishing theorems for Frobenius
split varieties were based on direct limits and Serre's vanishing theorem, but
our theorem is based on inverse limits and Grothendieck's theorem on formal
functions. The result implies a Grauert--Riemenschneider type theorem.

"alg-geom/9202010",,"John B. Little","Another Relation Between Approaches to the Schottky Problem","9 pages, Plain TeX",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  The recent extensive work on different approaches to the Schottky problem has
produced marked progress on several fronts. At the same time, it has become
apparent that there exist very close connections between the various
characterizations of Jacobian varieties described in Mumford's classic lectures
{\it Curves and Their Jacobians\/}. Until now, the approach via double
translation manifolds has seemed to be quite different from other approaches to
the Schottky problem. The purpose of this paper is to bring this last approach
``into the fold'' as it were, and to show precisely how it relates to
characterizations of Jacobians based on trisecants and flexes of the Kummer
variety, and the K.P. equation.

$W_n$ appearing as hamiltonian structures of generalized KdV hierarchies. The
classical limit is obtained by taking the commutative limit of the ring of
pseudodifferential operators. These algebras---denoted $w_n$---have free field
realizations in which the generators are given by the elementary symmetric
polynomials in the free fields. We compute the algebras explicitly and we show
that they are all reductions of a new algebra $w_{\rm KP}$, which is proposed
as the universal classical $W$-algebra for the $w_n$ series. As a deformation
of this algebra we also obtain $w_{1+\infty}$, the classical limit of
$W_{1+\infty}$.

integrable two-dimensional continuum field theories. We analyze the novel
critical behavior of this model, seen as a perturbation of a minimal conformal
theory M_p: the leading thermodynamic singularities are simultaneously governed
by all fixed points M_p, M_{p-1}, ..., M_3. The exponents of the magnetic
susceptibility and the specific heat are obtained exactly. Various corrections
to scaling are discussed, among them a new type specific to crossover phenomena
between critical fixed points.
