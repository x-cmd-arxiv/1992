surface is related to the 16th Hilbert problem. We prove in this paper new
restrictions on arrangement of nonsingular real algebraic curves on an
ellipsoid. These restrictions are analogues of Gudkov-Rokhlin,
Gudkov-Krakhnov-Kharlamov, Kharlamov-Marin congruences for plane curves (see
e.g. \cite{V} or \cite{V1}). To prove our results we follow Marin approach
\cite{Marin} that is a study of the quotient space of a surface under the
complex conjugation. Note that the Rokhlin approach \cite{R} that is a study of
the 2-sheeted covering of the surface branched along the curve can not be
directly applied for a proof of Theorem \ref{Rokhlin} since the homology class
of a curve of Theorem \ref{Rokhlin} can not be divided by 2 hence such a
covering space does not exist.

"hep-th/9202055",,"A. Mikovic","Canonical Quantization of 2d Gravity Coupled to c<1 Matter","17",,,,"hep-th",,"  We study 2d gravity coupled to $c,1$ matter through canonical quantization of
a free scalar field, with background charge, coupled to gravity. Various
features of the theory can be more easily understood in the canonical approach,
like gauge indipendence of the path-integral results and the absence of the
local physical degrees of freedom. By performing a non-canonical transformation
of the phase space variables, we show that the theory takes a free-field form,
i.e. the constraints become the free-field Virasoro constraints. This implies
that the David-Distler-Kawai results can be derived in the gauge indipendent
way, and also proves the free-field assumption which was used for obtaining the
spectrum of the theory in the conformal gauge. A discussion of the physical
spectrum of the theory is presented, with an analysis of the unitarity of the
discrete momentum states.

describe $d$-brane models in a space of $d+1$ dimensions. These equations, like
the recently discovered scalar field equations in $d+1$ dimensions, are
universal, in the sense that they can be derived from an infinity of
inequivalent Lagrangians, but are nonetheless Lorentz (Euclidean) invariant.
Moreover, they admit a hierarchical structure, in which they can be derived by
a sequence of iterations from an arbitrary reparametrisation covariant
Lagrangian, homogeneous of weight one. None of the equations of motion which
appear in the hierarchy of iterations have derivatives of the fields higher
than the second. The new sequence of Universal equations is related to the
previous one by an inverse function transformation. The particular case of
$d=2$, giving a new reparametrisation invariant string equation in 3 dimensions
is solved.
