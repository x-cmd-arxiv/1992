(i.e. complex tori) which are holomorphic outside a certain set of points
(markings) are studied. By an algebraic geometric degeneration process certain
subalgebras of Lie algebras of meromorphic vector fields on P^1 the Riemann
sphere are obtained. In case of some natural choices of the markings these
subalgebras are explicitly determined. It is shown that the number of markings
can change.

under multiplication by n on JC. We prove that the subgroup generated by these
cycles, in the Chow group modulo algebraic equivalence, has rank at most d-1,
where d is the gonality of C. We also discuss some general facts on the action
of n_* on the Chow groups.
