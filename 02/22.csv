  threefold","27 pages AmS-Tex 2.0 (plus 3 figures in LaTex)",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  Let f : X -> S be any elliptic fibration. If X has dimension 3 and is not
uniruled, then X has a minimal model (with terminal singularities) [Mori]. In
earlier work we have shown that there exists a birationally equivalent elliptic
fibration p: Y -> T such that Y is minimal and a multiple of K_Y can be
expressed as the pullback of a divisor from T. Moreover T has at worst quotient
singularities; it is not difficult to find examples where T is actually
singular. In this paper we describe the singularities of this parameter surface
T in the case of no multiple fibers. Although T is not uniquely determined by
the birational equivalence class of the fibration, any two such T are related
by a particular kind of birational map.

charged black hole are swallowed with probability one: the reflection
coefficient vanishes. However, quantum effects can lead to both electromagnetic
and gravitational backscattering. We show that, for the case of extremal,
magnetically charged, dilatonic black holes and a single flavor of low-energy
charged particles, this backscattering is described by a perturbatively
computable and unitary $S$-matrix, and that the Hawking radiation in these
modes is suppressed near extremality. The interesting and much more difficult
case of several flavors is also discussed.

of Euclidean or complexified general relativity is not a free field theory, but
is a theory that describes a linearized self-dual connection propagating on an
arbitrary anti-self-dual background. This theory is quantized in the loop
representation and, as in the full theory, an infinite dimnensional space of
exact solutions to the constraint is found. An inner product is also proposed.
The path integral is constructed from the Hamiltonian theory and the measure is
explicitly computed nonperturbatively, without relying on a semiclassical
expansion. This theory could provide the starting point for a new approach to
perturbation theory in $G_{Newton}$ that does not rely on a background field
expansion and in which full diffeomorphism invariance is satisfied at each
order.

integrals. A large number of different methods of integration of
Banach-space-valued functions have been introduced, based on the various
possible constructions of the Lebesgue integral. They commonly run fairly
closely together when the range space is separable (or has w^*-separable dual)
and diverge more or less sharply for general range spaces. The McShane integral
as described by [Go] is derived from the `gauge-limit' integral of [McS]. Here
we give both positive and negative results concerning it and the other three
integrals listed above.

  changed by arXiv admin to fix compilation problem (Dec2002)",,,"Stony Brook IMS 1992/3","math.DS",,"  We consider polynomial maps $f:\C\to\C$ of degree $d\ge 2$, or more generally
polynomial maps from a finite union of copies of $\C$ to itself which have
degree two or more on each copy. In any space $\p^{S}$ of suitably normalized
maps of this type, the post-critically bounded maps form a compact subset
$\cl^{S}$ called the connectedness locus, and the hyperbolic maps in $\cl^{S}$
form an open set $\hl^{S}$ called the hyperbolic connectedness locus. The
various connected components $H_\alpha\subset \hl^{S}$ are called hyperbolic
components. It is shown that each hyperbolic component is a topological cell,
containing a unique post-critically finite map which is called its center
point. These hyperbolic components can be separated into finitely many distinct
``types'', each of which is characterized by a suitable reduced mapping schema
$\bar S(f)$. This is a rather crude invariant, which depends only on the
topology of $f$ restricted to the complement of the Julia set. Any two
components with the same reduced mapping schema are canonically biholomorphic
to each other. There are similar statements for real polynomial maps, or for
maps with marked critical points.
