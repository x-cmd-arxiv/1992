We develop and describe new approaches to the problem of interacting Fermions
in spatial dimensions greater than one. These approaches are based on
generalizations of powerful tools previously applied to problems in one spatial
dimension. We begin with a review of one-dimensional interacting Fermions. We
then introduce a simplified model in two spatial dimensions to study the role
that spin and perfect nesting play in destabilizing Fermion liquids. The
complicated functional renormalization group equations of the full problem are
made tractable in our model by replacing the continuum of points that make up
the closed Fermi line with four Fermi points. Despite this drastic
approximation, the model exhibits physically reasonable behavior both at
half-filling (where instabilities occur) and away from half-filling (where a
Luttinger liquid arises). Next we implement the Bosonization of higher
dimensional Fermi surfaces introduced by Luther and advocated most recently by
Haldane. Bosonization incorporates the phase space and small-angle scattering

$W_3^{\infty}$ symmetry associated with Zamolodchikov's $W_3$ algebra which are
different from the previously explored $sl_3$ Toda realization of
$W_3^{\infty}$. We deduce the Boussinesq and modified Boussinesq equations as
constraints on the geometry of the corresponding coset manifolds.The main
characteristic features of these realizations are:i. Among the coset parameters
there are the space and time coordinates $x$ and $t$ which enter the Boussinesq
equations, all other coset parameters are regarded as fields depending on these
coordinates;ii. The spin 2 and 3 currents of $W_3$ and two spin 1 $U(1)$ Kac-
Moody currents as well as two spin 0 fields related to the $W_3$currents via
Miura maps, come out as the only essential parameters-fields of these cosets.
The remaining coset fields are covariantly expressed through them;iii.The Miura
maps get a new geometric interpretation as $W_3^{\infty}$ covariant constraints
which relate the above fields while passing from one coset manifold to another;
iv. The Boussinesq equation and two kinds of the modified Boussinesq equations
appear geometrically as the dynamical constraints accomplishing $W_3^{\infty}$
covariant reductions of original coset manifolds to their two-dimensional
geodesic submanifolds;v. The zero-curvature representations for these equations
arise automatically as a consequence of the covariant reduction. The approach
proposed could provide a universal geometric description of the relationship
between $W$-type algebras and integrable hierarchies.

"hep-th/9210059",,"S.Bellucci, E.Ivanov and S.Krivonos","N=3 Supersymmetric Extension of KdV Equation","13 pages, LaTeX",,,,"hep-th",,"  We construct a one-parameter family of N=3 supersymmetric extensions of the
KdV equation as a Hamiltonian flow on N=3 superconformal algebra and argue that
it is non-integrable for any choice of the parameter. Then we propose a
modified N=3 super KdV equation which possesses the higher order conserved
quantities and so is a candidate for an integrable system. Upon reduction to
N=2, it yields the recently discussed ``would-be integrable'' version of the
N=2 super KdV equation. In the bosonic core it contains a coupled system of the
KdV type equation and a three-component generalization of the mKdV equation. We
give a Hamiltonian formulation of the new N=3 super KdV equation as a flow on
some contraction of the direct sum of two N=3 superconformal algebras.

the supercurrent supermultiplet, which contains the energy-momentum tensor, is
transformed by the nonlocal symmetry of the model into the isospin current
supermultiplet. This effect incorporates supersymmetry into the known
infinite-dimensional Yangian deformation symmetry of plain $\sigma$-models,
leads to precisely the same nontrivial extension of the two-dimensional
super-Poincar\'e group as found previously for the Poincar\'e group, and thus
determines the theory's mass spectrum. A generalization to all higher-order
nonlocal charges is conjectured such that their generating function, the
so-called ``master charge'', has a definite Lorentz spin which depends on the
spectral parameter.
