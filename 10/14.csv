proof of S. Lang's conjecture to smooth plane curves. Let $C$ be a smooth plane
curve defined by an equation of degree $d$ with integral coefficients. We show
that for $d\ge 7$, the curve $C$ has only finitely many points whose field of
definition has degree $\le d-2$ over $Q$, and that for $d\ge 8$, all but
finitely many points of $C$ whose field of definition has degree $\le d-1$ over
$Q$ arise as points of intersection of rational lines through rational points
of $C$.

integer $d=C\cdot\lambda$. When $C$ generates $X$, we find a lower bound on $d$
which depends on $n$ and the degree of the polarization $\lambda$. The smallest
possible degree is $d=n$ and is obtained only for a smooth curve in its
Jacobian with its principal polarization (Ran, Collino). The cases $d=n+1$ and
$d=n+2$ are studied. Moreover, when $X$ is simple, it is shown, using results
of Smyth on the trace of totally positive algebraic integers, that if $d\le
1.7719\, n$, then $C$ is smooth and $X$ is isomorphic to its Jacobian. We also
get an upper bound on the geometric genus of $C$ in terms of its degree.

  Lyman absorption","8 pages Astronomy Astrophysics TEX",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The average flux decrement shortward the Ly$_{\alpha}$ emission, due to the
well-known ``forest'' of absorptions, has been measured in the spectra of 8
quasars. Quasi-simultaneous optical and IUE observations of the two low
redshift quasars PKS 0637--75 (z=0.654) and MC 1104+16 (z=0.632) have been
carried out, obtaining relatively high S/N, spectrophotometrically calibrated
data on their energy distribution from the rest frame H$_{\beta}$ to the Lyman
continuum. Six more quasars in the redshift range 2.5-3.4 have been observed in
the optical domain. For all the quasars the ``intrinsic'' continuum slope and
normalization have been estimated longward the Ly$_{\alpha}$ emission and
extrapolated towards the Lyman continuum to measure the average depressions,
which have been compared with the model statistics of the Ly$_{\alpha}$ clouds.
When all the known classes of absorbers are taken into account with plausible
values for their equivalent width distribution and evolution, a good agreement
is obtained with the observations. The results for the observed continuum
decrement at $z \sim 0.65$ are identical to those predicted by the evolution
with redshift of the number of Ly$_{\alpha}$ forest systems including the HST
data and within $2\sigma$ of the predicted value using the ``standard''
Ly$_{\alpha}$ evolution (as determined only at high z).

qualitatively new approach to optical fibers. We present a candidate for such a

$I=\bigcup_j(a_{2j-1},a_{2j})$ and $\chi_I(y)$ is the characteristic function
of the set $I$. In the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) the probability that no
eigenvalues lie in $I$ is equal to $\tau(a)$. Also $\tau(a)$ is a tau-function
and we present a new simplified derivation of the system of nonlinear
completely integrable equations (the $a_j$'s are the independent variables)
that were first derived by Jimbo, Miwa, M{\^o}ri, and Sato in 1980. In the case
of a single interval these equations are reducible to a Painlev{\'e} V
equation. For large $s$ we give an asymptotic formula for $E_2(n;s)$, which is
the probability in the GUE that exactly $n$ eigenvalues lie in an interval of
length $s$.
