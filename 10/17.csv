coefficient D(x) in a model of classically diffusing particles is investigated.
The renormalization group approach above the lower critical dimension d=0 is
applied to the distribution P(D) using the n-replica approach. In the annealed
approximation (n=1), the inverse gaussian distribution is found to be the
stable one under rescaling. This identification is made based on symmetry
arguments and subtle relations between this model and that of fluc- tuating
interfaces studied by Wallace and Zia. The renormalization-group flow for the
ratios between consecutive cumulants shows a regime of pure diffusion for small
disorder, in which P(D) goes to delta(D-<D>), and a regime of strong disorder
where the cumulants grow infinitely large and the diffusion process is ill
defined. The boundary between these two regimes is associated with an unstable
fixed-point and a subdiffusive behavior: <x**2>=Ct**(1-d/2). For the quenched
case (n goes to 0) we find that unphysical operators are generated raisng
doubts on the renormalizability of this model. Implications to other random
systems near their lower critical dimension are discussed.

However, as a remnant of Fermi statistics a nonlocal sign factor arises for

particle content. We estimate the value of the upper limit to be $m_{\hcirc} <
146$ GeV for 100 GeV < $M_t$ < 145 GeV, from all effects except possibly
additional heavy fermions beyond top (which could increase the limit by 0-20
GeV if any existed); for $M_t$ > 145 GeV the limit decreases monotonically. We
expect to be able to decrease the value of the upper limit by at least a few
percent by very careful analysis of the conditions. It is not normal in models
for the actual mass to saturate the upper limit.

the validity of the effective potential for inhomogeneous configurations. In an
attempt to get some insight into the importance of derivative terms, we analyze
a simple model, a kink in (1+1) dimensions and zero temperature. We evaluate
the energy shift from the quantum fluctuations about the non-uniform background
({\it i.e.}, the effective action) and compare it to the energy from the
effective potential. Our results clearly show that for inhomogeneous
configurations it may be inadequate to omit derivative terms and confine
oneself to the effective potential. We then couple the kink field to an
additional scalar field and perform the same comparison. The addition of the
second field allows us to vary the mass of the fluctuations and their coupling
to the underlying kink. If the mass of the second field is large, it does not
feel the inhomogeneities in the kink field and consequently does not give rise
to important derivative corrections in the effective action. In contrast, if
the mass is small, derivative terms are significant and the effective potential
fails. In the latter regime we can, however, rely on the Born approximation to
calculate the effective action.

there is a distinct state space for each theory in the family, with the
collection of spaces forming a vector bundle. This paper establishes the
equivalence of a deformed theory with that in a nearby state space in the
bundle via a connection that defines maps between nearby state spaces. We find
that an appropriate connection for establishing equivalence is one that arose
in a recent paper by Kugo and Zwiebach. We discuss the affine geometry induced
on the space of backgrounds by this connection. This geometry is the same as
the one obtained from the Zamolodchikov metric.
