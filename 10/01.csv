dissipative map with the inverse golden mean rotation number. On the basis of a
decimation scheme, it is argued that the (minimal) slope of the critical
iterated circle map is proportional to the effective Jacobian determinant.
Approaching the zero-Jacobian-determinant limit, the factor of proportion
becomes a universal constant. Numerical investigation on the dissipative
standard map suggests that this universal number could become observable in
experiments. The decimation technique introduced in this paper is readily
applicable also to the discrete quasiperiodic Schrodinger equation.

microcanonical system. The density of states $\nu$ is expressed formally as a
functional integral over Lorentzian metrics and is a functional of the
geometrical boundary data that are fixed in the corresponding action. These
boundary data are the thermodynamical extensive variables, including the energy
and angular momentum of the system. When the boundary data are chosen such that
the system is described semiclassically by {\it any} real stationary
axisymmetric black hole, then in this same approximation $\ln\nu$ is shown to
equal 1/4 the area of the black hole event horizon. The canonical and grand
canonical partition functions are obtained by integral transforms of $\nu$ that
lead to ""imaginary time"" functional integrals. A general form of the first law
of thermodynamics for stationary black holes is derived. For the simpler case
of nonrelativistic mechanics, the density of states is expressed as a real-time
functional integral and then used to deduce Feynman's imaginary-time functional

carry metrics of constant negative curvature. These manifolds are thus elements
of {\em hyperbolic geometry}, as natural as Euclid's regular polyhedra. For a
closed manifold, Mostow rigidity assures that a hyperbolic structure is unique
when it exists, so topology and geometry mesh harmoniously in dimension 3.
  This remarkable theorem applies to all 3-manifolds, which can be built up in
an inductive way from 3-balls, i.e., {\em Haken} manifolds. Thurston's
construction of a hyperbolic structure is also inductive. At the inductive step
one must find the right geometry on an open 3-manifold so that its ends may be
glued together. Using quasiconformal deformations, the gluing problem can be
formulated as a fixed-point problem for a map of Teichm\""uller space to itself.
Thurston proposes to find the fixed point by {\em iterating} this map.
  Here we outline Thurston's construction and sketch a new proof that the
iteration converges. Our argument rests on a result entirely in the theory of
Riemann surfaces: an extremal quasiconformal mapping can be relaxed (isotoped
to a map of lesser dilatation) when lifted to a sufficiently large covering
space (e.g., the universal cover). This contraction gives an immediate estimate
for the contraction of Thurston's iteration.

$\operatorname{Ext}_\tau$ on the category of noncommutative smooth algebras,
for any Fr\'echet operator ideal $\Cal K_\tau$. Combining the techniques
devised by Arveson and Voiculescu, we generalize Voiculescu's theorem to smooth
algebras and Fr\'echet operator ideals. A key notion involved is
$\tau$-smoothness, which is verified for the algebras of smooth functions, via
a noncommutative Sobolev lemma. The groups $\operatorname{Ext}_\tau$ are
computed for many examples.
