in the proof of Proposition 4.3 in my paper ""The Homogeneous Coordinate Ring of
a Toric Variety"", and 2) the original (unchanged) version of the paper,
published in 1995. The original paper introduced the homogeneous coordinate
ring of a toric variety (now called the total coordinate ring or Cox ring) and
gave a quotient construction. The paper also studied sheaves on a toric
variety, and in Section 4 described its automorphism group. The error in the
proof of Proposition 4.3 resulted from the faulty assumption that a certain set
of graded endomorphisms forms a ring; rather, it is a monoid under composition.
The erratum notes this error and gives a correct proof of the proposition.

is dominant and correlations decrease the band gap. Screening the long- range

formalism, and prove some rigorous theorems on the regularity properties and
possible pathologies of the RG map. Regarding regularity, we show that the RG
map, defined on a suitable space of interactions (= formal Hamiltonians), is
always single-valued and Lipschitz continuous on its domain of definition. This
rules out a recently proposed scenario for the RG description of first-order
phase transitions. On the pathological side, we make rigorous some arguments of
Griffiths, Pearce and Israel, and prove in several cases that the renormalized
measure is not a Gibbs measure for any reasonable interaction. This means that
the RG map is ill-defined, and that the conventional RG description of
first-order phase transitions is not universally valid. For decimation or
Kadanoff transformations applied to the Ising model in dimension $d \ge 3$,
these pathologies occur in a full neighborhood $\{ \beta > \beta_0 ,\, |h| <
\epsilon(\beta) \}$ of the low-temperature part of the first-order
phase-transition surface. For block-averaging transformations applied to the
Ising model in dimension $d \ge 2$, the pathologies occur at low temperatures
for arbitrary magnetic-field strength. Pathologies may also occur in the
critical region for Ising models in dimension $d \ge 4$. We discuss in detail
the distinction between Gibbsian and non-Gibbsian measures, and give a rather
complete catalogue of the known examples. Finally, we discuss the heuristic and
numerical evidence on RG pathologies in the light of our rigorous theorems.
