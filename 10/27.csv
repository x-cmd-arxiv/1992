investigated. We demonstrate how a hot big bang and a hot big crunch can arise
in some models. In particular, we examine why particle horizons do not occur in
matter and radiation models. We also discuss under what circumstances
exponential inflation and matter/radiation decoupling can happen. Finally,
without assuming any particular equation of state, we show that physical
singularities can occur in both untilted and tilted universe models if certain
assumptions are satisfied, similar to the (3+1)-dimensional cases.

sources of gauge field theories in the confining phase in D=3 or D=4 space-time
dimensions can be formulated, in the infrared limit, as a suitable 2D conformal
field theory on surfaces with quark loops as boundaries. Recent results on
self-avoiding random surfaces allow to fix almost uniquely such a conformal
theory. As a consequence, some universal relationships among the string tension
, the thickness of the colour flux tube, the deconfinement temperature and a
lower bound of the glueball mass spectrum are found. The general agreement with
the data extracted from recent lattice simulations with different gauge groups
is rather impressive.(Talk held by F.Gliozzi at Lattice'92 , Amsterdam)

one given by the heavy quark pair mass $\M^2$\ and the other by
$\Lambda_{QCD}^2/(1-x)$. When these two scales are comparable, the twist
expansion of Perturbative QCD breaks down. We discuss the dynamics in this new
QCD limit, where $\mu^2=\M^2(1-x)$ is held fixed as $\M^2\to \infty$. New
diagrams are found to contribute, which can enhance the cross section above
that expected for leading twist. The heavy quarks are produced by a peripheral
scattering on the target of hardness $\mu^2$. This leads, in particular, to a
nuclear target dependence of $A^{2/3}$ at small $\mu$. Qualitatively, the
dynamics in the new limit agrees with earlier phenomenological models of
``intrinsic'' heavy quark production.
