as a divisor with normal crossing. We study the bundles of logarithmic 1-forms
corresponding to such divisors` from the point of view of classification of
vector bundles on $P^n$. It turns out that all such bundles are stable. The
study of jumping lines of these bundles gives a unified treatment of several
classical constructions associating a curve to a collection of points in $P^n$.
The main result of the paper is ""Torelli theorem"" which says that the
collection of hyperplanes can be recovered from the isomorphism class of the
corresponding logarithmic bundle unless the hyperplanes ocsulate a rational
normal curve. In this latter case our construction reduces to that of secant
bundles of Schwarzenberger.

breaking driven by gaugino condensation and show that this gives a description
of gaugino condensation equivalent, at tree level, to other effective
Lagrangian approaches based on the symmetries of the theory. A study of the
mass gap equation shows that non-perturbative effects favour the appearance of
a gaugino condensate. By minimizing the effective potential describing both the
condensate and the moduli determining the gauge coupling constant and radius of
compactification we show that large hierarchy may occur between the gravitino
mass and the Planck mass with the existence of only one gaugino condensate.
Associated with this is a determination of the fine structure constant and the
compactification scale.
