  Quantum Hall Effect Systems","40 pages,P-92-10-122",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.47.7080",,"cond-mat",,"  We calculate the electromagnetic response functions of a Fractional Quantum
Hall system within the framework of the fermion Chern-Simons theory for the
Fractional Hall Effect (FQHE) which we developed before. Our results are valid
in a semiclassical expansion around the average field approximation (AFA). We
reexamine the AFA and the role of fluctuations. We argue that,
order-\-by-\-order in the semiclassical expansion, the response functions obey
the correct symmetry properties required by Galilean and Gauge Invariance and
by the incompressibility of the fluid. In particular, we find that the
low-momentum limit of the semiclassical approximation to the response functions
is exact and that it saturates the $f$-sum rule.We obtain the spectrum of
collective excitations of FQHE systems in the low-momentum limit. We find a
rich spectrum of modes which includes a host of quasiparticle- quasihole bound
states and, in general,two collective modes coalescing at the cyclotron
frequency. The Hall conductance is obtained from the current-density
correlation function, and it has the correct value already at the semiclassical
level. We applied these results to the problem of the screening of external
charges and fluxes by the electron fluid, and obtained asymptotic expressions
of the charge and current density profiles, for different types of
interactions. Finally, we reconsider the anyon superfluid within our scheme and
derive the spectrum of collective modes for interacting hard-core bosons and
semions. In addition to the gapless phase mode, we find a set of gapped
collective modes.

the proposed approach using several examples. In particular, we study the
perturbation to the energy spectrum of periodic superlattice induced by the
introduction of an enlarged well. We found that these perturbations are
negligible for B//z but relevant for B$\perp $z. Preliminary results for
Fibonacci superlattices in magnetic fields are presented as well. In these
quasi-periodic structures the energy levels become strongly dispersive in
presence of a perpendicular magnetic field.

D=3 gravity (or equivalently by parallel-moving cosmic strings in D=4) permit
closed timelike curves (CTC) only at the price of Misner identifications that
correspond to unphysical boundary conditions at spatial infinity and to a
tachyonic center of mass. Here we analyze geometries one or both of whose
sources are lightlike.
  We make manifest both the presence of CTC at spatial infinity if they are
present at all, and the tachyonic character of the system: As the total energy
surpasses its tachyonic bound, CTC first begin to form at spatial infinity,
then spread to the interior as the energy increases further. We then show that,
in contrast, CTC are entirely forbidden in topologically massive gravity for
geometries generated by lightlike sources.

results from horizontal symmetries, which arise from the compactification. In
particular, I show that in a class of free fermionic standard--like models, the
suppression of the mass terms for the lightest generation is a general, and
unambiguous, characteristic of these models. I show that the mixing between the
generations is suppressed due to the horizontal symmetries. I conclude that
these models may potentially explain the generation mass hierarchy.
