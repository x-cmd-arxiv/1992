gauge anomalies. I show how heavy fermions do not decouple in the presence of
discrete gauge anomalies. As a consequence, in general, cancellation of
discrete gauge anomalies cannot be described merely in terms of low energy
operators involving only the light fermions. I also discuss cancellation of
discrete gauge anomalies through a discrete version of the Green-Schwarz (GS)
mechanism as well as the possibility of discrete gauge R-symmetries and their
anomalies.
  Finally, some phenomenological applications are discussed. This includes
symmetries guaranteeing absence of FCNC in two-Higgs models and generalized
matter parities stabilizing the proton in the supersymmetric standard model. In
the presence of a discrete GS mechanism or/and gauge R-symmetries, new
possibilities for anomaly free such symmetries are found.

to target space duality. We generalize this duality to backgrounds with
non--abelian isometries. The procedure we follow consists of gauging the
isometries of the original action and constraining the field strength $F$ to
vanish. This new action generates dual theories by integrating over either the
Lagrange multipliers that set F=0 or the gauge fields. We find that this new
duality transformation maps spaces with non--abelian isometries to spaces that
may have no isometries at all. This suggests that duality symmetries in string
theories need to be understood in a more general context without regard to the
existence of continuous isometries on the target space (this is also indicated
by the existence of duality in string compactifications on Calabi--Yau
manifolds which have no continuous isometries). Physically interesting examples
to which our formalism apply are the Schwarzschild metric and the 4D charged
dilatonic black hole. For these spherically symmetric black holes in four
dimensions, the dual backgrounds are presented and explicitly shown to be new
solutions of the leading order string equations. Some of these new backgrounds
are found to have no continuous isometries (except for time translations) and
also have naked singularities.

cross section measured in heavy ion collisions are estimated for $^{197}$Au and
$^{59}$Co targets. The quadrupole process is assumed to proceed primarily
through excitation of the giant isovector quadrupole resonance, which then
decays by neutron emission. For $^{59}$Co, the contribution from E2 radiation
is found to be small, while for $^{197}$Au we find the quadrupole contribution
resolves the discrepancy between experiment and the simple predictions of the
Weissacker-Williams virtual photon method.
