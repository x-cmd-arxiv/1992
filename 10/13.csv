  C.V. Vishveshwars, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1993)",,,"gr-qc hep-th quant-ph",,"  A pedagogical introduction is given to the quantum mechanics of closed
systems, most generally the universe as a whole. Quantum mechanics aims at
predicting the probabilities of alternative coarse-grained time histories of a
closed system. Not every set of alternative coarse-grained histories that can
be described may be consistently assigned probabilities because of quantum
mechanical interference between individual histories of the set. In the quantum
mechanics of closed systems, containing both observer and observed,
probabilities are assigned to those sets of alternative histories for which
there is negligible interference between individual histories as a consequence
of the system's initial condition and dynamics. Such sets of histories are said
to decohere. Typical mechanisms of decoherence that are widespread in our
universe are illustrated. Copenhagen quantum mechanics is an approximation to
the more general quantum framework of closed subsystems. It is appropriate when
there is an approximately isolated subsystem that is a participant in a
measurement situation in which (among other things) the decoherence of
alternative registrations of the apparatus can be idealized as exact. Since the
quantum mechanics of closed systems does not posit the existence of the
quasiclassical domain of everyday experience, the domain of the approximate
aplicability of classical physics must be explained. We describe how a
quasiclassical domain described by averages of densities of approximately
conserved quantities could be an emergent feature of an initial condition of
the universe that implies the approximate classical behavior of spacetime on
accessible scales.

classical modular transformation properties. An extension of the definition of
a unitary transformation is briefly discussed and is used to find the inner
product in the holonomy variables which makes the canonical transformation
unitary. This defines the Hilbert space in the Witten-Carlip formulation which
is unitarily equivalent to the natural Hilbert space in the Moncrief

logarithmic corrections. On lattices from size $8^4$ to $24^4$, Monte-Carlo

necessary to remove the dominant lattice artifacts induced by the chiral
symmetry breaking term in the Wilson action. Our final results are in good

emerges that, although the string field action does not coincide with the
world-sheet (matter) partition function in general, these functions do coincide
on shell. This can be demonstrated in general, as long as matter and ghosts are
decoupled.

chirality assignments in the underlying superstring theory. An important

cocycles of group extensions valued in certain groups of unitary operators
acting in a Hilbert space (e.g the Fock space of chiral fermions), when dealing
with groups associated to current algebras in gauge theories in $3+1$
space-time dimensions. The appropriate cocycle is evaluated in the case of the
group of smooth maps from the physical three-space to a compact Lie group. The
cocyclic representation of a component $X$ of the current is obtained through
two regularizations, 1) a conjugation by a background potential dependent
unitary operator $h_A,$ 2) by a subtraction $-h_A^{-1}\Cal L_X h_A,$ where
$\Cal L_X$ is a derivative along a gauge orbit. It is only the total operator
$h_A^{-1} Xh_A-h_A^{-1}\Cal L_X h_A$ which is quantizable in the Fock space
using the usual normal ordering subtraction.

bring about saturation, and present schematic calculations to illustrate this.
We find that a very small density-dependence in $g_A$ gives rise to a very
large saturating effect on nuclear matter. In fact, this new saturation
mechanism turns out to be more powerful than any of the conventional
mechanisms.
