of transient patterns which occur in the evolution between two spatially
homogeneous states. This phenomenon occurs, for example, during the
Freedericksz transition in nematic liquid crystals.The dynamics leads to the
emergence of finite domains which are locally periodic and independent of each
other. This picture is substantiated by a finite-size scaling law for the
structure factor. The mechanism of evolution towards the final homogeneous
state is by local roll destruction and associated reduction of local
wavenumber. The scaling law breaks down for systems of size comparable to the
size of the locally periodic domains. For systems of this size or smaller, an
apparent nonlinear selection of a global wavelength holds, giving rise to long
lived periodic configurations which do not occur for large systems. We also
make explicit the unsuitability of a description of transient pattern dynamics
in terms of a few Fourier mode amplitudes, even for small systems with a few
linearly unstable modes.

current is involved in the construction of the globally conserved currents of
energy-momentum and total angular momentum. For the construction of conserved
currents corresponding to (approximate) scale and proper conformal symmetries,
however, an improved energy-momentum current is needed. By extending the
Minkowskian framework to a genuine metric-affine spacetime, we find that the
affine Noether identities and the conformal Killing equations enforce this
improvement in a rather natural way. So far, no gravitational dynamics is
involved in our construction. The resulting dilation and proper conformal
currents are conserved provided the trace of the energy-momentum current
satisfies a (mild) scaling relation or even vanishes.

positive frequency part $\wt{\frak{g}}^+$ of loop algebras. These are given by
the values of the spectral parameters at the divisors corresponding to
eigenvector line bundles over the associated spectral curves, defined within a
given matrix representation. A Liouville generating function is obtained in
completely separated form and shown, through the Liouville-Arnold integration
method, to lead to the Abel map linearization of all Hamiltonian flows induced
by the spectral invariants. Serre duality is used to define a natural
symplectic structure on the space of line bundles of suitable degree over a
permissible class of spectral curves, and this is shown to be equivalent to the
Kostant-Kirillov symplectic structure on rational coadjoint orbits. The general
construction is given for $\frak{g}=\frak{gl}(r)$ or $\frak{sl}(r)$, with
reductions to orbits of subalgebras determined as invariant fixed point sets
under involutive automorphisms. The case $\frak{g=sl}(2)$ is shown to reproduce
the classical integration methods for finite dimensional systems defined on
quadrics, as well as the quasi-periodic solutions of the cubically nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation. For $\frak{g=sl}(3)$, the method is applied to the
computation of quasi-periodic solutions of the two component coupled nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation.
