SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the maximally abelian gauge. We focus on the the
dual Meissner effect. We find that the transverse distribution of the
longitudinal chromoelectric field due to a static quark-antiquark pair
satisfies the dual London equation. Moreover we show that the size of the flux
tube scales according to asymptotic freedom.

loss suffered by high energy quarks and gluons in nuclear matter. The bound
shows that the nuclear suppression observed in quarkonium production at high
$x_F$ cannot be explained in terms of energy loss of the initial or final
parton states. We also argue that no nuclear suppression is expected in the
photoproduction of light hadrons at large $x_F$.

"hep-th/9210132","Qmw Theory Group","J.L. Vazquez-Bello","The Search for Zoo-Perparticles","24pp",,,"QMW-PH-92-13","hep-th",,"  This paper reviews the covariant formalism of N=1, D=10 classical
superparticle models. It discusses the local invariances of a number of
superparticle actions and highlights the problem of finding a covariant
quantization scenario. Covariant quantization has proved problematic, but it
has motivated in seeking alternative approaches that avoids those found in
earlier models. It also shows new covariant superparticle theories formulated
in extended spaces that preserve certain canonical form in phase-space, and
easy to quantize by using the Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure, as the gauge
algebra of their constraints only closes on-shell. The mechanics actions
describe particles moving in a superspace consisting of the usual $N=1$
superspace, together with an extra spinor or vector coordinate. A light-cone
analysis shows that all these new superparticle models reproduce the physical
spectrum of the N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory.

of a massive and spinning free particle in anti-de~Sitter spacetime, using a
phase space rather than a spacetime representation. The regularizing character
of the curvature appears clearly in connection with a notion of localization in
phase space which is shown to disappear in the zero curvature limit. We show in
particular how the anti-de~Sitter optimally localized (coherent) states
contract to plane waves as the curvature goes to zero. In the first part we
give a detailed description of the classical theory {\it \a la Souriau\/}. This
serves as a basis for the quantum theory which is constructed in the second
part using methods of geometric quantization. The invariant positive K\""ahler
polarization that selects the anti-de~Sitter quantum elementary system is shown
to have as zero curvature limit the Poincar\'e polarization which is no longer
K\""ahler. This phenomenon is then related to the disappearance of the notion of
localization in the zero curvature limit.

detailed study of the four tachyon amplitude shows that the $W_3$ string must
possess additional states in its spectrum associated with intercept $1/2$ and
the energy operator of the Ising model.
