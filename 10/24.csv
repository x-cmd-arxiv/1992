non-linear hydrodynamic equations. The Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism is used to
calculate renormalized transport coefficients to one-loop order. Similar
theories for isotropic liquids have shown substantial increases of the
viscosities as the liquid is supercooled or compressed due to feedback from the
density fluctuations which are freezing. We find similar results here for the
longitudinal and various shear viscosities of the nematic. However, the two
viscosities associated with the nematic director motion do not grow in any
dramatic way; i.e.\ there is no apparent freezing of the director modes within
this hydrodynamic formalism. Instead a glassy state of the nematic may arise
from a ``random anisotropy"" coupling of the director to the frozen density.

While for RSA without diffusion the coverage approaches its maximum jamming
value (large-time fractional coverage) exponentially, added diffusion allows
the deposition process to proceed to the full coverage. The approach to the
full coverage is consistent with the t**(-1/2) power law reminiscent of the
equilibrium cluster coarsening in models with nonconserved order-parameter
dynamics.

symmetry of the theory and the composite field $j$ appearing as the coefficient
of the Schwinger term in the current algebra, together with the derivatives of

light-cone components of the energy-momentum tensor consists of two commuting
copies of the Virasoro algebra, with central charge $\, c\!=\!0 $, reflecting
the classical conformal invariance of the theory, but the current algebra part
and the semidirect product structure are quite different from the usual
Kac-Moody / Sugawara type construction.

state which is symmetric under the interchange of a pair of indistinguishable
vortices can be transformed into an antisymmetric state after the passage
through the system of a third vortex with an appropriate $H$-flux element.
Further, there exist states containing two indistinguishable spinless vortices
which obey Fermi statistics. These results generalize to loops of nonabelian
cosmic string in 3+1 dimensions. In the second model, fractional analogues of
the above behaviors occur. Also, composites of vortices in this theory may
possess fractional ``Cheshire spin'' which can be changed by passing an
additional vortex through the system.
