Gruner and Shyamsunder Erramilli","Pressure Induced Topological Phase Transitions in Membranes","12 pages, typed using REVTEX 2.0",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.3455",,"cond-mat",,"  Some highly unusual features of a lipid-water liquid crystal are revealed by
high pressure x-ray diffraction, light scattering and dilatometric studies of
the lamellar (bilayer $L_{\alpha}$) to nonlamellar inverse hexagonal ($H_{II}$)
phase transition. (i) The size of the unit cell of the $H_{II}$ phase increases
with increasing pressure. (ii) The transition volume, $\Delta V_{bh}$,
decreases and appears to vanish as the pressure is increased. (iii) The
intensity of scattered light increases as $\Delta V_{bh}$ decreases. Data are
presented which suggest that this increase is due to the formation of an
intermediate cubic phase, as predicted by recent theoretical suggestions of the
underlying universal phase sequence.

in the low energy limit all the successful tree level predictions of the hidden
local symmetry in the SU(2)${}_L$$\times$SU(2)${}_R$$/$SU(2)${}_V$ chiral
Lagrangian. Most amazingly, the $\rho$ meson dominance of the pion
electromagnetic form factor survives the one-loop corrections at any momentum,
if and only if we take the parameter choice $a=2$. For the choice $a=1$
(``vector limit""), $a$ is not renormalized ($Z_a=1$) and no deviation from
$a=1$ is induced by the loop effects of the hidden gauge bosons. Actually,
$a=1$ is a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point.
