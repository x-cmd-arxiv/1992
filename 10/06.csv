systems in the confining phase , for very large quark separations, are
described in terms of two-dimensional conformal field theories. The constraints
induced by the gauge theory at the boundaries of the effective string induce a
Coulomb- like term in the interquark potential which is universal, but
different from the one proposed by L\""uscher. Some universal relations among
the string tension, the thickness of the colour flux tube, the location of the
deconfining temperature and a lower bound of the glueball spectrum are
discussed. (Lectures given at the XXXII Cracow School of Theoretical Physics,

  Radiative Kaon Decays","15 pages (input of phyzzx.tex is required), IP-ASTP-17-92",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In pure chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) the couplings of higher order
Lagrangian terms are running parameters and hence can be determined only
empirically from various low-energy hadronic processes. While this scenario
works well for strong interactions, it is unsatisfactory for nonleptonic and
radiative nonleptonic weak interactions: It is impossible, from the outset, to
determine all unknown higher-order chiral couplings by experiment; theory is
tested only by certain chiral constraints rather than by its quantitative
predictions. Based on a QCD-motivated model for $p^4$ strong chiral Lagrangian
valid in the limit of large $N_c$, one can derive large-$N_c$ fourth-order
effective chiral Lagrangians for $\Delta S=1$ nonleptonic weak interactions and
radiative weak transitions. Applications to
$K\ri\pi\pi\pi,~K\ri\pi\gamma\gamma$, and $K\ri\pi\pi\gamma$ are discussed.
