solutions are nonsingular. In particular, there is neither a big bang nor a big
crunch. The action is a higher derivative modification of Einstein's theory
constructed in analogy to how the action for point particle motion in special
relativity is obtained from Newtonian mechanics.

  Discovery of CMB Anisotropies","25 pages, 10 figures (available from the author), uses phyzzx",,,"BROWN-HET-881","hep-ph astro-ph",,"  The COBE satellite has discovered anisotropies in the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) consistent with a scale invariant spectrum of density
perturbations. As reviewed in this lecture, topological defect models of
structure formation generically produce such a spectrum. We give a summary of
the cosmic string and global texture models, focusing on distinct observational
signatures in large-scale structure surveys and in the microwave background. It
is shown that the amplitude of the CMB quadrupole detected by COBE is in good
agreement with the predictions of the cosmic string model.
