first order phase transitions can exist, one at the $SU(2)_R$ breaking scale,
the other at the usual $SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y$ breaking scale. Even though more
parameters are present than the standard model, we find that the electroweak
phase transition is still too weak to allow baryon asymmetry to survive the
transition, if the lower bound of the Higgs boson mass from experiment is
adhered to.

soliton properties to the dilaton coupling. In order that the predicted strange

parameter has to be about (400 MeV)$^4$, which agrees with the result obtained

These are of two types. First, assuming that string theory is the correct
underlying theory of all interactions, we ask whether there are any generic
predictions the theory makes, and we compare the predictions of string theory
with those of conventional grand unified theories. Second, string theory offers
some possible answers to a number of troubling naturalness questions. These
include problems of discrete and continuous symmetries in general, and CP and
the strong CP problem in particular.

The conserved angular momentum is constructed in the presence of a non-abelian

modifications on conventional angular momentum are discussed in close analogy
with monopole systems. The diatomic molecular system discussed by Zygelman is
found to have a similar structure to that of a non-abelian $SU(2)$ charge
coupled to a 't Hooft - Polyakov monopole. The abelian limit of the Berry
potential in diatomic systems is shown to be the same as $U(1)$ monopole and in
a large separation limit, we observe the decoupling associated with a vanishing
field tensor.
