probes at various field sizes and depths have been obtained in a low extinction
window in the galactic anticentre direction. Such data set strong constraints
on the radial structure of the disc. At the forefront of this ""drilling""
program, very deep CCD frames probe the most external parts of the disc. Over
the whole effective magnitude range (18 to 25), all contributions in the
statistics which should be expected from old disc stars beyond 6 kpc vanish,
although such stars dominate by far at distances less than 5 kpc. This is the
signature of a sharp cut-off in the star density: the edge of the galactic disc
between 5.5 and 6 kpc. As a consequence, the galactic radius does not exceed 14
kpc (assuming $R/-/(//sun/)$=8.5). Colours of elliptical galaxies measured in
the field rule out the risk of being misled by undetected extinction.

framework to investigate the high energy behaviour of many systems. Motivated
by these simple considerations we present a systematic formalism which
explicitly provides the front form fields appropriate for constructing a

a transformation matrix $\Omega(j)$ is constructed which determines how the

fields. Explicit results for the front form hadronic fields up to spin two are
catalogued in appendixes. For spin one half, the $\Omega(1/2)$ coincides with
