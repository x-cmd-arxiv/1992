phase is performed on a hypercubic lattice in search of an $I=1$, $J=1$
resonance. We investigate the region of the cutoff theory where the interaction
is strong as it is there that a resonance would be expected to have a better
chance to form. In that region the presence of an $I=1$, $J=1$ resonance with
mass below the cutoff is excluded. NOTE: The full ps file is also available via

dimensions of a $\gamma_5$-Yukawa model using differential renormalization. The
calculation is carried out in coordinate space without modifying the space-time
dimension and no ad-hoc prescription for $\gamma_5$ is needed.
  It is shown that this procedure is specially suited for theories involving
$\gamma_5$, and it should be considered in analyzing chiral gauge theories.

hamiltonian reduction of $A(n|n-1)^{(1)}$ we get the free field realization of
$N=2$ $CP_{n}$ super coset models. In the case of the affine Lie superalgebras
$A(n|n)^{(1)}$, the corresponding conformal field theories do not have $N=2$
superconformal symmetry. However we show that these models are twisted $N=2$
$CP_{n}$ models and may be regarded as topological conformal field theories.
