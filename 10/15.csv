(C$_{12}$), and on the C$_{60}$ molecule is studied. Within the Hartree-Fock
approximation, we find a magnetic-like instability of the `Fermi sea' towards a
spin-ordered phase for an intermediate value of the coupling ${\rm
(U/t)_c}\approx 2.6$. The ordered phase presents a spin arrangement similar to
that of the classical Heisenberg model defined on the same clusters. We study
the linear excitations around the Hartree-Fock ground states using the
random-phase approximation. On a finite cluster, we expect that these results
signal the presence of a $rapid$ $crossover$ between a paramagnetic region and
a regime where spin correlations are important. The relationship with the
Heisenberg limit (large ${\rm U/t}$) is discussed. Finally, we comment on
implications of our results for purely repulsive models of superconductivity in
alkali-metal-doped fullerenes.

spacetime is subject to quantum fluctuations. A generalized D-dimensional
spacetime metric of the form $g_{\mu \nu}=e^a_\mu \eta_{ab} e^b_\nu$ is
introduced, where $\eta_{ab} = diag\{e^{i\theta},1,...,1\}$. The corresponding
functional integral for quantized fields then interpolates from a Euclidean
path integral in Euclidean space, at $\theta=0$, to a Feynman path integral in
Minkowski space, at $\theta=\pi$. Treating the phase $e^{i\theta}$ as just
another quantized field, the signature of spacetime is determined dynamically
by its expectation value. The complex-valued effective potential $V(\theta)$
for the phase field, induced by massless fields at one-loop, is considered. It
is argued that $Re[V(\theta)]$ is minimized and $Im[V(\theta)]$ is stationary,
uniquely in D=4 dimensions, at $\theta=\pi$, which suggests a dynamical origin
for the Lorentzian signature of spacetime.

  These $2$-dimensional tilings are obtained by application of the strip method
to the root lattice of an $ADE$-Coxeter group.
  The plane along which the strip is constructed is determined by the canonical
Coxeter element leading to the result that a $2$-dimensional tiling decomposes
into a cartesian product of two $1$-dimensional tilings.
  The properties of the tilings are investigated, including selfsimilarity, and
the determination of the relevant algebraic invariant is considered, namely the
ordered $K_0$-group of an algebra naturally assigned to the quantum space.

  corrected. 24 pages, USC-92/HEP-B5",,,,"hep-th",,"  In this lecture I summarize recent developments on strings propagating in
curved spacetime. Exact conformal field theories that describe gravitational
backgrounds such as black holes and more intricate gravitational singularities
have been discovered and investigated at the classical and quantum level. These
models are described by gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models, or equivalently
current algebra G/H coset models based on non-compact groups, with a single
time coordinate. The classification of such models for all dimensions is
complete. Furthermore the heterotic superstrings in curved spacetime based on
non-compact groups have also been constructed. For many of the $d\le 4$ models
the gravitational geometry described by a sigma model has been determined. Some
general results outlined here include a global analysis of the geometry and the
exact classical geodesics for any G/H model. Moreover, in the quantized theory,
the conformally exact metric and dilaton are obtained for all orders in an
expansion of $k$ (the central extension). All such models have large-small (or
mirror) duality properties which we reformulate as an inversion in group space.
To illustrate model building techniques a specific 4-dimensional heterotic
string in curved spacetime is presented. Finally the methods for investigating
the quantum theory are outlined. The construction and analysis of these models
at the classical and quantum level involve some aspects of noncompact groups
which are not yet sufficiently well understood. Some of the open problems in
the physics and mathematics areas are outlined.
