dimensions are in good agreement with Schwinger-Dyson solutions of the ladder
graphs of conventional $QED$ and they satisfy the hyperscaling relations
expected of a relativistic renormalizable field theory. The spectroscopy
results satisfy the constraints of the Goldstone mechanism and PCAC, and may be
indicative of Technicolor versions of the Standard Model which are strongly
coupled at short distances.

presented to illustrate the efficiency. An idea to find such algorithms is also
presented, which may be applicable to other distributions of interest in Monte

crossing-invariant models solvable by Bethe Ansatz. In the case of the XXZ
Heisenberg chain we derive, for arbitrary values of the anysotropy, a single
non-linear integral equation from which the free energy can be exactly
calculated.These equations are shown to be equivalent to an infinite set of
algebraic equations of Bethe type which provide alternatively the
thermodinamics.
  The high-temperature expansion follows in a sistematic and relatively simple
way from our non-linear integral equations. For low temperatures we obtain the
correct central charge and predict the analytic structure of the full expansion
around T=0. Furthermore, we derive a single non-linear integral equation
describing the finite-size ground-state energy of the Sine-Gordon quantum field
theory.

constant background field and discuss some of new aspects of the theory. It is
shown that the term with the antisymmetric field has a topological nature like
a Chern-Simons term or a Wess-Zumino term. Due to this property, the theory
exhibits various anomalous behavior: Zero mode variables obey nontrivial
quantization conditions. Coordinate transformations which define orbifolds are
modified at the quantum level. Wavefunctions of twisted strings acquire phase
factors when they move around non-contractible loops on orbifolds. Zero mode
eigenvalues are shifted from naively expected values, in favor of modular
invariance.

with symplectic twist maps. We present theorems of decomposition by symplectic
twist maps and existence of periodic orbits for these systems. The novelty of
these results resides in the fact that no explicit asymptotic condition is
imposed on the system. We also present a theorem of suspension by Hamiltonian
systems for the class of symplectic twist map that emerges in our study.
Finally, we extend our results to manifolds of negative curvature.
