as AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) and GBHC (Galactic Black Hole Candidates) is
universal, irrespective of the nature of the emitted particles. A comparison of
the energy spectrum for cosmic rays at the source and $\gamma$-rays from
quasars obtained recently by CGRO (Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) indicates
that the prediction is in agreement with the data in the average sense. This
suggests that neutrinos from point sources should have a spectral index
identical to that of $\gamma$-rays for an individual point source. This
prediction is also consistent with the recent observation of neutrinos by
Kamiokande and IMB in which the ratio of $\nu_\mu/\nu_e$ is close to 1, instead
of 2 as expected from atmospheric neutrinos. For a further test of the model,
analysis of the time variation of $\gamma$-ray spectra from quasars is
suggested.

hopping $t_\perp$, is solved exactly by bosonization technique. It is shown
that $t_\perp$ does modify the shape of the Fermi surface also in presence of
interaction, although charge and spin excitations keep different velocities
$u_\rho$, $u_\sigma$. Two different regimes occur: at short distances, $x\ll
\xi = (u_\rho - u_\sigma)/4t_\perp$, the two chain model is not sensitive to
$t_\perp$, while for larger separation $x\gg \xi$ inter--chain hopping is
relevant and generates further singularities in the electron Green function
besides those due to spin-charge decoupling. (2 figures not included. Figure

  Supersymmetry requires the presence of $B\wedge R\wedge R\wedge

is an interesting toy model of the black hole dynamics. The functional measures
of gravity part are explicitly evaluated and derive the Wheeler-DeWitt like
equations as physical state conditions. In ADM formalism the measures are very
ambiguous, but in our formalism they are explicitly defined. Then the new
features which are not seen in ADM formalism come out. A singularity appears at
$\df^2 =\kappa (>0) $, where $\kappa =(N-51/2)/12 $ and $ N$ is the number of
matter fields. At the final stage of the black hole evaporation, the Liouville
term becomes important, which just comes from the measures of the fields.
Behind the singularity the quantum mechanical region $\kappa > \df^2 >0 $
extends, where the sign of the kinetic term in the Wheeler-DeWitt like equation
changes. If $\kappa <0 $, the singularity disappears. We briefly discuss the
possibility of gravitational tunneling and the issue of the information loss.
