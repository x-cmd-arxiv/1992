processes that occur when hyperthermal alkali atoms scatter off metallic
surfaces. Following Brako and Newns, we expand the electronic many-body
wavefunction in the number of particle-hole pairs (we keep terms up to and
including a single particle-hole pair). We extend their earlier work by
including level crossings, excited neutrals and negative ions. The full set of
equations of motion are integrated numerically, without further approximations,
to obtain the many-body amplitudes as a function of time. The velocity and
work-function dependence of final state quantities such as the distribution of
ion charges and excited atomic occupancies are compared with experiment. In
particular, experiments that scatter alkali ions off clean Cu(001) surfaces in
the energy range 5 to 1600 eV constrain the theory quantitatively. The
neutralization probability of Na$^+$ ions shows a minimum at intermediate
velocity in agreement with the theory. This behavior contrasts with that of
K$^+$, which shows ... (7 figures, not included. Figure requests:

magnetic dipole moments at finite temperature. We find that at one loop there
is an interaction term of the Chern-Simon form ${\cal L_I}=m_\mu\>A_\nu {\tilde
F}^{\mu\nu}$. The four vector $m_\mu \simeq d_i \mu_i m_i^2
~{\partial_\mu}\>(ln T)$ is interpreted as a Chern- Simon type mass of photons,
which is determined by the electric (magnetic) dipole moments $d_i$ ($\mu_i$)
of the fermions in the vacuum polarisation loop diagram. The physical
consequence of such a photon mass is that, photons of opposite circular
polarisations, propagating through a hot medium, have different group
velocities. We estimate that the time lag between the arrival times of the left
and right circularly polarised light signals from pulsars. If the light
propagates through a hot plasma (where the temperature in some regions is $T
\sim 100 MeV$) then the time lag between the two circularly polarised signals
of frequency $\omega$ will be $\Delta t(\omega) \simeq 10^{-6} /\omega$. It may
be possible to observe this effect in pulsar signals which propagate through
nebula at high temperatures.

large-$S$ limit, where the field takes values in the manifold of the $SO(3)$
group. No topological term is induced in the action and the cases for integer
spin and half-integer spin appear to be indistinguishable. A one-loop $\beta
-$function calculation indicates that the theory flows towards a strong
coupling (disordered) phase at long distances. This is verified in the
large-$N$ limit, where all excitations are shown to be massive. (Three figures
