scaling law in terms of the macroscopic parameters such as the fractal

sensitive to the microscopic structure of the clusters and depends on: site- or

and polarization, presence or absence of polarizability disorder. This
situation makes the derivation of macroscopic parameters from Raman experiments
unreliable.

in numerical simulations when extracting weak matrix elements using staggered
fermions. This extends previous calculations of Golterman and Smit, and Daniel
and Sheard. In particular, we calculate the corrections for non-local bilinears
defined in Landau gauge with gauge links excluded. We do this for the simplest
operators, i.e. those defined on a $2^4$ hypercube, and for tree level improved
operators which live on $4^4$ hypercubes. We also consider gauge invariant
operators in which the ``tadpole'' contributions are suppressed by projecting
the sums of products of gauge links back in to the gauge group. In all cases,
we find that the variation in the size of the perturbative corrections is
smaller than those with the gauge invariant unimproved operators. This is most
strikingly true for the smeared operators. We investigate the efficacy of the
mean-field method of Lepage and Mackenzie at summing up tadpole contributions.
In a companion paper we apply these results to four-fermion operators.

that chiral-symmetry-breaking dynamics at a high energy scale plays a
significant role in electroweak symmetry breaking. In order for there to be a
large hierarchy between the scale of the high energy dynamics and the weak
scale, the high energy theory must have a second order chiral phase transition.
If the transition is second order, then close to the transition the theory may
be described in terms of a low-energy effective Lagrangian with composite
``Higgs'' scalars. However, scalar theories in which there are more than one
$\Phi^4$ coupling can have a {\it first order} phase transition instead, due to
the Coleman-Weinberg instability. Therefore, top-condensate or strong ETC
theories in which the composite scalars have more than one $\Phi^4$ coupling
cannot always support a large hierarchy. In particular, if the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model solved in the large-$N_c$ limit is a good
approximation to the high-energy dynamics, then these models will not produce
acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking.

is shown that the photon is massless in the Coulomb phase due to spontaneous
breaking of the magnetic symmetry group. The generators of this group are the
magnetic fluxes through any infinite surface $\Phi_S$. The order parameter for
this symmetry breaking is the operator $V(C)$ which creates an infinitely long
magnetic vortex. We show that although the order parameter is a stringlike
rather than a local operator, the Goldstone theorem is applicable if $<V(C)>\ne
0$. If the system is properly regularized in the infrared, we find $<V(C)>\ne
0$ in the Coulomb phase and $V(C)=0$ in the Higgs phase. The Higgs - Coulomb
phase transition is therefore understood as condensation of magnetic vortices.
The electric charge in terms of $V(C)$ is topological and is equal to the
winding number of the mapping from a circle at spatial infinity into the
manifold of possible vacuum expectation values of a magnetic vortex in a given
direction. Since the vortex operator takes values in $S^1$ and
$\Pi_1(S^1)={\cal Z}$, the electric charge is quantized topologically.
