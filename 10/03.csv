"hep-lat/9210006","Tvaughan","Timothy E. Vaughan","Basis States for Hamiltonian QCD with Dynamical Quarks","15 pages, LaTeX, BUHEP-92-33",,,,"hep-lat",,"  We discuss the construction of basis states for Hamiltonian QCD on the
lattice, in particular states with dynamical quark pairs. We calculate the
matrix elements of the operators in the QCD Hamiltonian between these states.
Along with the ``harmonic oscillator'' states introduced in previous pure SU(3)
work, these states form a working basis for calculations in full QCD.

1960's and the impact of the experiments on deep inelastic scattering. I recall
the steps that lead from the attempts to understand these experiments to the
discovery of asymptotic freedom in 1973 and the subsequent rapid emergence,
development and acceptance of the non-Abelian gauge theory of color (QCD) as
the theory of the strong interactions.

and Physics at the Planck Energy Scale. In this talk a review of earlier work
on finite temperature strings was presented. Several topics were covered,
including the canonical and microcanonical ensemble of strings, the behavior of
strings near the Hagedorn temperature as well as speculations on the possible
phases of high temperature strings. The connection of the string ensemble and,
more generally, statistical systems with an exponentially growing density of
states with number theory was also discussed.

to matter is considered. It is shown that the linear dilaton vacuum
spontaneously breaks half the supersymmetries, leaving broken a linear
combination of left and right supersymmetries which squares to time
translations. Supersymmetry suggests a spinorial expression for the ADM energy
$M$, as found by Witten in four-dimensional general relativity. Using this
expression it is proven that ${M}$ is non-negative for smooth initial data
asymptotic (in both directions) to the linear dilaton vacuum, provided that the
(not necessarily supersymmetric) matter stress tensor obeys the dominant energy
condition. A {\it quantum} positive energy theorem is also proven for the
semiclassical large-$N$ equations, despite the indefiniteness of the quantum
stress tensor. For black hole spacetimes, it is shown that $M$ is bounded from
below by $e^{- 2 \phi_H}$, where $\phi_H$ is the value of the dilaton at the
apparent horizon, provided only that the stress tensor is positive outside the
apparent horizon. This is the two-dimensional analogue of an unproven
conjecture due to Penrose. Finally, supersymmetry is used to prove positive
energy theorems for a large class of generalizations of dilaton gravity which
arise in consideration of the quantum theory.

and loops) via the Kibble mechanism of domain (bubble) formation in the
isotropic to nematic phase transition of a sample of uniaxial nematic liquid

\pm 0.01$. This is in good agreement with the theoretical value $1/ \pi$
expected in two dimensions for the order parameter space $S^2/{\bf Z}_2$ of a
simple uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. ( NB: The only change is a correction
of the preprint number for proper referencing and the title page.)
