the Tate-Shafarevich group has the interpretation of isomorphism classes of
elliptic curves over the function field of $S$ which have the same jacobian as
the generic fibre of $f$, and for which there exists a relatively minimal model

fibrations with isolated multiple fibres, and also to give a new counterexample
to the Luroth problem in dimension three. This is a revised, hopefully
improved, version with a few extra theorems and a few errors corrected.

"astro-ph/9210006","Ethan Vishniac","Ethan T. Vishniac","On the Origin of the Galactic Magnetic Field","20 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The galactic magnetic field is commonly supposed to be due to a dynamo acting
on some large scale seed field. A major difficulty with this idea is that
estimates of reasonable seed field strengths tend to be quite low, on the order
of $\sim10^{-20}$ gauss. Here we examine the contribution due to the flux
entrained in winds from protostars formed in the first dynamo e-folding time of
a galaxy's existence. Using a minimal estimate of a protostellar magnetic field
we find that if each protostar ejects a single current ring, sufficient to
maintain flux freezing in the wind, than the large scale average dipole field
from all such current rings will be at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than
previous seed field estimates. Allowing for a reasonable amount of magnetic
activity in protostars during an extended period of mass loss increases this to
a dipole seed field of $\sim10^{-12}$ gauss. For the purposes of producing a
seed field it is irrelevant whether or not this initial injection of flux takes
place in a newly formed galactic disk, or in star forming proto-galactic
clouds. The compression of this dipole field into a thin disk will lead to a
large scale $B_r\sim 10^{-10.5}$ gauss. Initially, field strengths on smaller
scales will be larger, but nowhere near current levels.

experimental consequences. This model is a new string-inspired flipped $SU(5)$
which unifies at the string scale $M_U=10^{18}\GeV$ due to the introduction of
an additional pair of \r{10},\rb{10} flipped $SU(5)$ representations which
contain new intermediate scale `gap' particles. We study various model-building
issues which should be addressed in string-derived incarnations of this model.
We focus our study on the no-scale supergravity mechanism and explore
thoroughly the three-dimensional parameter space of the model ($m_{\tilde
g},m_t,\tan\beta$), thus obtaining several simple relationships among the
particle masses, such as: $m_{\tilde q}\approx m_{\tilde g}$, $m_{\tilde
e_L}\approx m_{\tilde\nu}\approx0.30 m_{\tilde g}$, $m_{\tilde
e_R}\approx0.18m_{\tilde g}$, and $m_{\chi^0_2}\approx2m_{\chi^0_1}\approx
m_{\chi^\pm_1}$. In a strict interpretation of the no-scale supergravity
scenario we solve for $\tan\beta$ as a function of $m_t$ and $m_{\tilde g}$,
and show that $m_t$ determines not only the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter
$\mu$ but also whether the lightest Higgs boson mass is above or below
$100\GeV$. We also find that throughout the parameter space the neutralino
relic abundance is within observational bounds ($\Omega_\chi h^2_0\lsim0.25$)
and may account for a significant portion of the dark matter in the Universe.

structure of the perturbative series of the theory is presented. We start by
analyzing the two-point Green's function, in the Bloch-Nordsieck approximation.
The theory appears to be plagued by severe infrared divergencies, which
nevertheless disappear when vacuum-polarization effects are non-perturbatively
taken into account. The dynamical induction of a Chern-Simons term is at the
root of this mechanism. {}From the inspection of the electron-electron
non-relativistic potential it then follows that equally charged fermions may
either repel or attract and, moreover, that bound states do in fact exist in
the theory. We calculate numerically the binding energies and average radius of
the bound states. We find an accidental quasi-degeneracy of the ground state of
the system, between the lowest-energy $l=-3$ and $l=-5$ states, which could be
related to a radio-frequency resonance in high-$T_c$ superconductors.
