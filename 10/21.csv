binary LMC cluster NGC 1850 using BV CCD images and echelle spectra of 52
supergiants. Isochrone fits to a BV color-magnitude diagram revealed that the
primary cluster has an age of $\tau = 90 \pm 30$ Myr while the secondary member
has $\tau = 6 \pm 5$ Myr. BV surface brightness profiles were constructed out
to R $>$ 40 pc, and single-component King-Michie (KM) models were applied. The
total cluster luminosity varied from L$_B$ = 2.60 - 2.65 $\times 10^6$
L$_B$\sol\ and L$_V$ = 1.25 - 1.35 $\times 10^6$ as the anisotropy radius
varied from infinity to three times the scale radius with the isotropic models
providing the best agreement with the data. Of the 52 stars with echelle
spectra, a subset of 36 were used to study the cluster dynamics. The KM radial
velocity distributions were fitted to these velocities yielding total cluster
masses of 5.4 - 5.9 $\pm 2.4 \times 10^4$ M\sol\ corresponding to M/L$_B$ =
0.02 $\pm 0.01$ M\sol/L$_B$\sol\ or M/L$_V$ = 0.05 $\pm 0.02$ M\sol/L$_V$\sol.
A rotational signal in the radial velocities has been detected at the 93\%
confidence level implying a rotation axis at a position angle of 100\deg. A
variety of rotating models were fit to the velocity data assuming cluster
ellipticities of $\epsilon = 0.1 - 0.3$. These models provided slightly better
agreement with the radial velocity data than the KM models and had masses that
were systematically lower by a few percent. The preferred value for the slope
of a power-law IMF is a relatively shallow, $x = 0.29 \pmm{+0.3}{-0.8}$
assuming the B-band M/L or $x = 0.71 \pmm{+0.2}{-0.4}$ for the V-band.

in a Very Broad Line Region (VBLR), where the radiation field is so strong that
the Str\""omgren depth becomes similar to the geometrical thickness of the

govern the quasiclassical domain of familiar experience is considered in the

sets of histories that are quasiclassical, i.e. such that the individual
histories obey, with high probability, effective classical equations of motion
interrupted continually by small fluctuations and occasionally by large ones.
We discuss these requirements generally but study them specifically for coarse
grainings of the type that follows a distinguished subset of a complete set of
variables while ignoring the rest. More coarse graining is needed to achieve
decoherence than would be suggested by naive arguments based on the uncertainty
principle. Even coarser graining is required in the distinguished variables for
them to have the necessary inertia to approach classical predictability in the
presence of the noise consisting of the fluctuations that typical mechanisms of
decoherence produce. We describe the derivation of phenomenological equations
of motion explicitly for a particular class of models. Probabilities of the
correlations in time that define equations of motion are explicitly considered.
Fully non-linear cases are studied. Methods are exhibited for finding the form
of the phenomenological equations of motion even when these are only distantly
related to those of the fundamental action. The demonstration of the connection
between quantum-mechanical causality and causalty in classical phenomenological
equations of motion is generalized. The connections among decoherence, noise,
dissipation, and the amount of coarse graining necessary to achieve classical
predictability are investigated quantitatively.

plausibly in the same universality class as the classical four component
Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Therefore, renormalization group techniques
developed in the study of phase transitions can be applied to calculate the
critical exponents which characterize the scaling behaviour of universal
quantities near the critical point. This approach to the QCD phase transition
has implications both for lattice gauge theory and for heavy ion collisions.
Future lattice simulations with longer correlation lengths will be able to
measure the various exponents and the equation of state for the order parameter
as a function of temperature and quark mass which we describe. In a heavy ion
collision, the consequence of a long correlation length would be large
fluctuations in the number ratio of neutral to charged pions. Unfortunately, we
show that this phenomenon will not occur if the plasma stays close to
equilibrium as it cools. If the transition is far out of equilibrium and can be
modelled as a quench, it is possible that large volumes of the plasma with the
pion field correlated will develop, with dramatic phenomenological
consequences. }

that, although in this renormalization scheme the value of the Green functions

prescription in which CST is perturbatively defined as the large mass limit of

regularization prescription the radiative corrections induced by two-loop

reabsorbed by a finite rescaling of the fields only. This very mechanism is
