moduli spaces of rank 2 bundles, including the Harder-Narasimhan formula and
the SU(2) Verlinde formula. Indeed, we prove a general result on the space of

due to long-range coupling between displacements $u$. The model is based on the
biharmonic equation $\nabla^{4}u =0$ in two-dimensional isotropic defect-free
media as follows from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation for pattern formation
-or, alternatively, from the theory of elasticity. As a difference with
Laplacian and Poisson growth models, in the new model the Laplacian of $u$ is
neither zero nor proportional to $u$. Its discretization allows to reproduce a
transition from dense to multibranched growth at a point in which the growth
velocity exhibits a minimum similarly to what occurs within Poisson growth in
planar geometry. Furthermore, in circular geometry the transition point is
estimated for the simplest case from the relation $r_{\ell}\approx L/e^{1/2}$
such that the trajectories become stable at the growing surfaces in a
continuous limit. Hence, within the biharmonic growth model, this transition
depends only on the system size $L$ and occurs approximately at a distance $60
\%$ far from a central seed particle. The influence of biharmonic patterns on
the growth probability for each lattice site is also analysed.

doublers can be completely removed from the physical spectrum by means of a
strong Wilson-Yukawa coupling. The lowest lying fermion spectrum in this phase
consists most probably only of a massive Dirac fermion which has charge zero
with respect to the $U(1)_L$ group. We give evidence that the fermion which is
charged with respect to that subgroup is absent in the VXS phase. When the
$U(1)_L$ gauge fields are turned on, the neutral fermion may couple chirally to
the massive vector boson state in the confinement phase. The outcome is very
similar to our findings in the strong coupling symmetric phase (PMS) of
fermion-Higgs models with Wilson-Yukawa coupling in four dimensions, with the
exception that in four dimensions the neutral fermion does most probably
decouple from the bosonic bound states.
