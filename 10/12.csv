theory. It is shown that the massless spectra of Calabi--Yau manifolds of
complex dimension $D_{crit}$ can be derived from noncritical manifolds of
complex dimension $2k + D_{crit}$, $k\geq 1$. These higher dimensional
manifolds are spaces whose nonzero Ricci curvature is quantized in a particular
way. This class is more general than that of Calabi--Yau manifolds because it
contains spaces which correspond to critical string vacua with no K\""ahler
deformations, i.e. no antigenerations, thus providing mirrors of rigid
Calabi--Yau manifolds. The constructions introduced here lead to new insights
into the relation between exactly solvable models and their mean field theories
on the one hand and Calabi--Yau manifolds on the other. They also raise
fundamental questions about the Kaluza--Klein concept of string
compactification, in particular regarding the r\^{o}le played by the dimension
of the internal theories.

used to derive two general soft-photon amplitudes, a two-s-two-t special
amplitude $M^{TsTts}_{\mu}$ and a two-u-two-t special amplitude
$M^{TuTts}_{\mu}$, where s, t and u are the Mandelstam variables.
$M^{TsTts}_{\mu}$ depends only on the elastic T-matrix evaluated at four sets
of (s,t) fixed by the requirement that the amplitude be free of derivatives
($\partial$T/$\partial$s and /or $\partial$T/$\partial t$). Likewise
$M^{TuTts}_{\mu}$ depends only on the elastic T-matrix evaluated at four sets
of (u,t). In deriving these amplitudes, we impose the condition that
$M^{TsTts}_{\mu}$ and $M^{TuTts}_{\mu}$ reduce to $\bar{M}^{TsTts}_{\mu}$ and
$\bar{M}^{TuTts}_{\mu}$, respectively, their tree level approximations. The
amplitude $\bar{M}^{TsTts}_{\mu}$ represents photon emission from a sum of
one-particle t-channel exchange diagrams and one-particle s-channel exchange
diagrams, while the amplitude $\bar{M}^{TuTts} _{\mu}$ represents photon
emission from a sum of one-particle t-channel exchange diagrams and
one-particle u-channel exchange diagrams. The precise expressions for
$\bar{M}^{TsTts}_{\mu}$ and $\bar{M}^{TuTts}_{\mu}$ are determined by using the
radiation decomposition identities of Brodsky and Brown. We point out that it
is theoretically impossible to describe all bremsstrahlung processes by using
only a single class of soft-photon amplitudes. At least two different classes
are required: the amplitudes which depend on s and t or the amplitudes which
depend on u and t. When resonance effects are important, the amplitude
$M^{TsTts}_{\mu}$, not $M^{Low(st)}_{\mu}$, should be used. For processes with
strong u-channel exchange effects, the amplitude $M^{TuTts}_{\mu}$ should be
the first choice.
