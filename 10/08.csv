an independent statement of quantum theory in spacetime form. It is different
from the usual Schr\""odinger-Heisenberg formulation that utilizes states on
spacelike surfaces because it assigns probabilities to different sets of
alternatives. Sum-over-histories quantum mechanics can be generalized to deal
with spacetime alternatives that are not ""at definite moments of time"". An
example in field theory is the set of alternative ranges of values of a field
averaged over a spacetime region. An example in particle mechanics is the set
of the alternatives defined by whether a particle never crosses a fixed
spacetime region or crosses it at least once. The general notion of a set of
spacetime alternatives is a partition (coarse-graining) of the histories into
an exhaustive set of exclusive classes. With this generalization the
sum-over-histories formulation can be said to be in fully spacetime form with
dynamics represented by path integrals over spacetime histories and
alternatives defined as spacetime partitions of these histories. When
restricted to alternatives at definite moments of times this generalization is
equivalent to Schr\""odinger-Heisenberg quantum mechanics. However, the quantum
mechanics of more general spacetime alternatives does not have an equivalent
Schr\""odinger-Heisenberg formulation. We suggest that, in the quantum theory of
gravity, the general notion of ""observable"" is supplied by diffeomorphism
invariant partitions of spacetime metrics and matter field configurations. By
generalizing the usual alternatives so as to put quantum theory in fully
spacetime form we may be led to a covariant generalized quantum mechanics of
spacetime free from the problem of time.

$c_0$, in the spirit of the author's 1974 characterization of Banach spaces
containing $\ell^1$.
  Definition: A sequence $(b_j)$ in a Banach space is called {\it strongly
summing\/} (s.s.) if $(b_j)$ is a weak-Cauchy basic sequence so that whenever
scalars $(c_j)$ satisfy $\sup_n \|\sum_{j=1}^n c_j b_j\| <\infty$, then $\sum
c_j$ converges.
  A simple permanence property: if $(b_j)$ is an (s.s.) basis for a Banach
space $B$ and $(b_j^*)$ are its biorthogonal functionals in $B^*$, then
$(\sum_{j=1}^n b_j^*)_{n=1}^ \infty$ is a non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in
$B^*$; hence $B^*$ fails to be weakly sequentially complete. (A weak-Cauchy
sequence is called {\it non-trivial\/} if it is {\it non-weakly convergent\/}.)
  Theorem. Every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in a (real or complex) Banach
space has either an {\rm (s.s.)} subsequence, or a convex block basis
equivalent to the summing basis.
  Remark : The two alternatives of the Theorem are easily seen to be mutually
exclusive.
  Corollary 1. A Banach space $B$ contains no isomorph of $c_0$ if and only if
every non-trivial weak-Cauchy sequence in $B$ has an {\rm (s.s.)} subsequence.
  Combining the $c_0$ and $\ell^1$ Theorems, we obtain
  Corollary 2. If $B$ is a non-reflexive Banach space such that $X^*$ is weakly
sequentially complete for all linear subspaces $X$ of $B$, then $c_0$ embeds in
$X$; in fact, $B$ has property~$(u)$.
